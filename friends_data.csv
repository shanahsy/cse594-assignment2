Phoebe Buffay,"Wait, does he eat chalk?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!",train

Monica Geller,"So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?",train
Rachel Green,"Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.",train
Monica Geller,Who wasn't invited to the wedding.,train

And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!",train

Rachel Green,"Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.",train
Monica Geller,"Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...",train
Rachel Green,"Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!",train
Monica Geller,"Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...",train
Rachel Green,I'm all better now.,train

Monica Geller,"Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?",train
Ross Geller,That'd be good...,train
Monica Geller,Really?,train
Ross Geller,"No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?",train
Monica Geller,"Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.",train

Ross Geller,"I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.",train

Joey Tribbiani,Shut up!,train
Chandler Bing,You must stop!,train
Ross Geller,That only took me an hour.,train
Chandler Bing,"Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it! I don't think that was my point!",train
Ross Geller,"You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...",train
Joey Tribbiani,"What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you!

Monica Geller,"Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry...",train

Monica Geller,Wow! I'm-I'm-I'm glad you smashed her watch!,train
Monica Geller,"...Yeah. Yeah, I do.",train
Rachel Green,Oh...see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference!,train
Ross Geller,"Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?",train

Chandler Bing,"Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here.,train

Chandler Bing,That is amazing.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Congratulations.,train

Monica Geller,"Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I'm an actor.",train
Rachel Green,Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?,train

Monica Geller,"Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, it was a job all right?",train
Chandler Bing,"'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'",train
Joey Tribbiani,I will not take this abuse.,train

Monica Geller,You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?,train
Joey Tribbiani,Of course it was a line!,train
Monica Geller,"Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?",train
Ross Geller,I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.,train
Monica Geller,I hate men! I hate men!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.",train
Monica Geller,Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.",train
Monica Geller,"I just thought he was nice, y'know?",train
Joey Tribbiani,I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!,train

Rachel Green,"You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!",train
Chandler Bing,"Oh, how well you know me...",train

Rachel Green,I know that. That's why I was getting married.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.",train
Rachel Green,Thank you.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.",train
Ross Geller,The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...,train
Monica Geller,"All right, you ready?",train
Rachel Green,"No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? ""Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?"" Come on, I can't do this!",train

Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah!",train
Rachel Green,Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.,train
Monica Geller,Absolutely.,train

Ross Geller,"Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.",train
Chandler Bing,"The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.",train

Rachel Green,Come on! You guys can pee standing up.,train

Monica Geller,"Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it.",train
Chandler Bing,"No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, if you want, I'll do it with you.",train
Chandler Bing,"Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her.",train

Ross Geller,Tony?,train
Monica Geller,"Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know.",train

Joey Tribbiani,You don't say.,train
Ross Geller,"So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama.",train

Rachel Green,Don't you have a laundry room in your building?,train
Ross Geller,"Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?",train

Ross Geller,"Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel.",train
Chandler Bing,"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?",train
Ross Geller,It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.,train

Rachel Green,"Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin.",train
Ross Geller,"Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things.",train

Ross Geller,"Do you uh, do you talk about me?",train
Ross Geller,Really?,train
Ross Geller,"Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say.",train
Chandler Bing,"I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head.",train
Monica Geller,"Hey, Rach, did you make your money?",train

Chandler Bing,"All right, I'm nine years old.",train

Rachel Green,"Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, will you just come in already?",train
Chandler Bing,"No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!",train
Chandler Bing,"Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots.",train
Monica Geller,That's not a question.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease.",train
Monica Geller,"All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots.",train

Monica Geller,"Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up.",train
Rachel Green,"Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!",train
Chandler Bing,The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.,train
Joey Tribbiani,The balloon?,train
Chandler Bing,"No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?",train
Rachel Green,"I can't, I gotta go.",train
Chandler Bing,Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?,train

Monica Geller,Joey!,train
Joey Tribbiani,That one will.,train
Ross Geller,"And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore.",train
Ross Geller,"Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?",train

Rachel Green,"Well, you should have.",train
Monica Geller,Why?,train
Rachel Green,Because!,train
Monica Geller,Why?,train
Rachel Green,Because!,train
Monica Geller,"Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I...",train
Chandler Bing,"Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go.",train

Joey Tribbiani,The bigger half.,train
Chandler Bing,"I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.",train

C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!",train
Rachel Green,"Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?",train

Rachel Green,That'd be good.,train
Ross Geller,"Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um...",train

Chandler Bing,Eh. I thought that was an alp.,train
Monica Geller,"Well, high school was not my favourite time.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex.",train

Monica Geller,"Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?",train
Phoebe Buffay,Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!,train
Chandler Bing,I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty.,train

Monica Geller,So have you called her yet?,train
Chandler Bing,"Let her know I like her? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right?",train
Monica Geller,I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!",train
Chandler Bing,"Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Her answer machine?,train
Chandler Bing,"No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"So, uh, why didn't you say anything?",train
Chandler Bing,"Oh, no-no-no-no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase ""Yes indeedy-o.""",train
Monica Geller,"Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!",train
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay, what's going on?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, they're just talking...",train

Chandler Bing,Hey Rach!,train
Monica Geller,How'd it go?,train

Phoebe Buffay,Not a good day for birds...,train
Rachel Green,"Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel...",train
Ross Geller,"That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?",train
Rachel Green,"Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!",train
Ross Geller,"That's, that's nice twice!",train
Monica Geller,"Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Duh, where've you been?",train

Chandler Bing,Yes!,train
Rachel Green,Why?,train
Chandler Bing,I have my reasons.,train

Monica Geller,"Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!",train
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here!,train
Monica Geller,"Great, now he's waving back.",train

Monica Geller,What kinda stuff?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked.",train
Phoebe Buffay,You cook naked?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters.",train
Chandler Bing,What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.,train

Chandler Bing,Can I use your phone?,train
Monica Geller,"Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone.",train
Chandler Bing,"Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?",train
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe she never got your message.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet.",train
Chandler Bing,Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...,train
Ross Geller,"...desperate, needy, pathetic?",train
Chandler Bing,"Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad.",train
Phoebe Buffay,How many beeps?,train
Chandler Bing,She answered.,train
Monica Geller,"Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about.",train
Chandler Bing,"I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy.",train
Phoebe Buffay,How'd he take it?,train
Rachel Green,"Pretty well, actually...",train
Monica Geller,"Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?",train

Chandler Bing,"I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride.",train
Monica Geller,Do you?,train
Chandler Bing,"No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back.

Ross Geller,At the vet.,train
Chandler Bing,"She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?",train

Joey Tribbiani,Hey! He beat ya.,train
Ross Geller,"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent.",train
Chandler Bing,So what does this mean?,train
Ross Geller,I'm gonna have to give him up.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!",train
Chandler Bing,"I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?",train

Joey Tribbiani,Isn't there any way you can keep him?,train
Ross Geller,"No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo.",train
Joey Tribbiani,How do you get a monkey into a zoo?,train
Chandler Bing,"I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen.",train
Ross Geller,"Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility.",train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey. We found her, we found the girl.",train
Chandler Bing,What?,train
Joey Tribbiani,Did you call the cops?,train
Rachel Green,Nope. We took her to lunch.,train
Chandler Bing,Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.,train
Ross Geller,What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.,train

Ross Geller,"Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.",train
Chandler Bing,...Take off their hats!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.,train
Rachel Green,No way. No way did you do this.,train
Monica Geller,It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!,train
Monica Geller,...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!,train
Rachel Green,"Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up.",train
Monica Geller,'Scuse me?,train
Monica Geller,"Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class.",train
Monica Geller,What?,train
Monica Geller,"Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned.",train
Monica Geller,Uh-huh.,train
Monica Geller,Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.,train

Phoebe Buffay,I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.,train
Ross Geller,"Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, somebody will.",train
Joey Tribbiani,You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?,train
Chandler Bing,You're kidding.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!,train
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, you'd think I would've.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?,train
Phoebe Buffay,...Flame Boy.,train
Ross Geller,Where exactly is your zoo?,train
Ross Geller,Yes.,train
Ross Geller,"No-no, he's, he's very docile.",train
Ross Geller,"Well I, I don't know. Why?",train
Ross Geller,"He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean...",train
Ross Geller,Why- why- why would he need a blade?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing...",train
Chandler Bing,...He's in.,train
Ross Geller,"He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!",train
Monica Geller,Yo- hooo!,train

Finally Chandler was like ""forget about her"" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, ""Oh my god."" So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh!

Rachel Green,I love you too.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that.",train
Monica Geller,"Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong.

Chandler Bing,You or me?,train
Ross Geller,"I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples.",train

Chandler Bing,"Ok, Phoebe.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true.",train

Chandler Bing,"Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed.",train
Monica Geller,What can we do for you?,train
Monica Geller,"Well, what about his family?",train
Rachel Green,"Ok, so let's talk money.",train
Monica Geller,"I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!",train
Rachel Green,Have you ever seen so much crap?,train
Chandler Bing,"Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap",train
Joey Tribbiani,Check this out. Can I have this?,train
Ross Geller,How can you not believe in evolution?,train
Phoebe Buffay,Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!,train

Monica Geller,Mmmmm.,train
Rachel Green,"Ok, while you ""mmm"" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp.",train
Ross Geller,"Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?",train
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.,train
Ross Geller,Please tell me you're joking.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't.",train
Ross Geller,"No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--",train
Phoebe Buffay,"What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope.",train

Joey Tribbiani,You could say that.,train
Ross Geller,"And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress.",train
Chandler Bing,Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?,train

Ross Geller,How'd the callback go?,train
Joey Tribbiani,It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.,train
Chandler Bing,So what'd you do?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way.",train
Ross Geller,Good for you.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part.",train
Phoebe Buffay,So... and?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!",train

Ross Geller,This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.,train

Ross Geller,Would it matter?,train
Monica Geller,"Oh, you are so great! Thank you!",train
Joey Tribbiani,Are you really not going?,train

Chandler Bing,"Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.",train
Monica Geller,"Ross, I thought you were over this.",train
Ross Geller,"Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.",train
Rachel Green,Did I miss it? Did I miss it?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.",train
Chandler Bing,"Whoa, she's pretty.",train

Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, what?",train
Monica Geller,What?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.",train
Chandler Bing,"Oh, ok.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"There's my scene, there's my scene. ""Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.",train
Joey Tribbiani,I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.,train

Chandler Bing,That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.",train
Monica Geller,"Oh, honey.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, ""ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage."" Little did she know God was thinking, ""Ok, but that's it."" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.",train
Rachel Green,What do you mean?,train
Phoebe Buffay,I think it went into me.,train
Monica Geller,"God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.",train
Chandler Bing,"Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.",train
Rachel Green,"Ok, who ordered what?",train
Ross Geller,"Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.",train
Chandler Bing,"Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?",train
Rachel Green,Oh god.,train
Joey Tribbiani,I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.,train
Rachel Green,"I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?",train
Phoebe Buffay,Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up!",train
Rachel Green,Mom!,train
Rachel Green,Pretty much.,train
Rachel Green,"This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.",train
Ross Geller,"Hi, Mrs. Green.",train

Phoebe Buffay,I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?,train
Rachel Green,"Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.",train
Rachel Green,"I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?",train
Rachel Green,For...me.,train
Rachel Green,"Well, what do you mean?",train
Monica Geller,"All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.",train
Rachel Green,Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.,train
Monica Geller,Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.,train
Ross Geller,And you had no idea they weren't getting along?,train
Rachel Green,None.,train
Joey Tribbiani,They didn't fight a lot?,train
Rachel Green,"No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"In my day, divorce was not an option.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, look who's up.",train
Rachel Green,"I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.",train
Monica Geller,"Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.",train
Rachel Green,"Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?",train
Chandler Bing,"You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.",train
Phoebe Buffay,That's him.,train
Chandler Bing,Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Um, do you wanna sit?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?",train
Phoebe Buffay,Everything?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.",train
Rachel Green,These are from Halloween three years ago.,train
Rachel Green,"No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.",train
Monica Geller,"Um, you guys, you know when I said before, ""thank you, but I don't really need your help""?",train
Rachel Green,"Actually, what I think you said was, ""don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen.""",train
Monica Geller,"Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.",train
Rachel Green,"Hey, Mon, you want some help?",train
Monica Geller,If you want.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.",train
Rachel Green,She's still with you?,train

Rachel Green,You want me to talk you out of it?,train
Rachel Green,Then what? What do you want?,train
Rachel Green,Why on earth would I understand this?,train
Rachel Green,Oh.,train
Monica Geller,"All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!",train
Chandler Bing,"Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.",train
Monica Geller,"Joey, speed it up!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.",train
Monica Geller,Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?,train
Phoebe Buffay,Sir! No sir!,train
Monica Geller,"All right, you!",train
Ross Geller,"No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.",train
Monica Geller,"All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called ""pigs in Ross"". All right, ball the melon.",train

Ross Geller,"I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.",train
Ross Geller,"Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.",train
Ross Geller,"Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.",train
Monica Geller,So we're back on?,train
Monica Geller,"You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.",train
Chandler Bing,"Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.",train
Ross Geller,Any time.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.",train
Monica Geller,Would you look at them?,train
Ross Geller,"Yeah, can't help but.",train

Ross Geller,That commercial always makes me so sad.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK.",train
Ross Geller,I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin.",train
Monica Geller,And the fact that they're both monkeys.,train
Ross Geller,"Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away.",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding.",train
Ross Geller,"Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it.",train

Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'm so glad you're here.",train

Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I don't know.",train
Rachel Green,What's the matter?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right.",train

Chandler Bing,"Well, before we answer that, I think we should address the more important question. How dumb are you?",train
Ross Geller,"What?! Look, we're trying to rebuild a relationship here, right. How am I supposed to do that here, without being totally honest with each other?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, Ross look, I'm on board about this totally honesty thing, I am, just not about stuff that's gonna get you in trouble.",train
Chandler Bing,"He's right. Nobody's gonna benefit, and you're just gonna hurt her.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, and there won't be a relationship left to rebuild.",train
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but don't you think....",train
Chandler Bing,"All right look, if you absolutely have to tell her, at least wait until the timing's right. And that's what deathbeds are for.",train
Ross Geller,"Yeah, okay.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, okay, now, we just have to make sure she doesn't find out some other way. Did you think about the trail?",train
Ross Geller,What trail?,train
Joey Tribbiani,The trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it! You always have to think about the trail!,train
Ross Geller,"Oh, I-I don't think there's any trail.",train
Chandler Bing,"Okay, okay-okay, ah, Chloe works with that guy Issac. Issac's sister is Jasmine. And Jasmine works at that message place with Phoebe. And Phoebe's friends with Rachel. And that's the trail, I did it!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"After applying the Waxine and linen strips to leg number one,",train

Monica Geller,"No. It was painful. Oh my God , they should call it Pain-zine, now with a little wax.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Huh, well, the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don't seem to think it's that bad.",train
Monica Geller,"That's because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid. But hey, y'know if you don't believe me, please, by my guest.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Ow-ow-ow-ow! Oh my God!!!,train
Monica Geller,"Now, are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?",train
Ross Geller,Chloe? Hi..,train
Ross Geller,You took my watch?,train
Ross Geller,"Just you keep it, listen did you, did you tell anyone about us?",train
Ross Geller,"Exactly. So you didn't, didn't mention anything to Issac right?",train

Ross Geller,"Yeah. Listen, can you keep this information to yourself?",train

Ross Geller,"Yes, I did.",train
Ross Geller,Very bad.,train
Ross Geller,"I'm agreeing with you. Did you, listen, did you happen to tell Phoebe yet?",train
Ross Geller,"Okay, Jasmine, please, please don't. I love my girlfriend very much, and I want more than anything to just work it out with her. Okay?",train
Ross Geller,"Thank you, thank you.",train
Ross Geller,Who's your roommate?,train

Monica Geller,We were just waxing our legs.,train
Chandler Bing,Off?!!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"For your information, this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience.",train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well I don't think you can make that statement, unless you've been kicked in an area that God only meant to be treated nicely.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I-I think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men, that's all. I mean, come on, it's just a little wax.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, come here.",train
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that's mature.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, fine, so now what, I just pull it off?",train
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.,train

Ross Geller,"Listen. Oh hey, hey, the important thing was that she meant, she meant nothing to me!",train
Rachel Green,And yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship!!,train
Ross Geller,"Look, I didn't think there was a relationship to jeopardise. I thought we were broken up.",train
Rachel Green,We were on a break!,train
Ross Geller,"That, for all I knew would, could last forever. That to me is a break-up.",train
Rachel Green,You think you're gonna get out of this on a technicality?,train

Rachel Green,All right. Let's say I had slept with Mark. Would you have been able to forgive me?,train
Ross Geller,Yes I would.,train
Rachel Green,"You'd be okay if you knew that Mark had kissed me, and been naked with me, and made love to me?",train

Rachel Green,That's....,train
Ross Geller,That's what?!,train

Rachel Green,"No. I can't, you're a totally different person to me now. I used to think of you as somebody that would never, ever hurt me, ever.

Phoebe Buffay,"Whoa!! He is soo unreasonable! God, although I think I understand what he means. Oh my God, this is like 60 Minutes, okay, when, when, at first you're really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow.",train
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what this is like? This is like when my parents got divorced. Man, I hope Ross doesn't try to kidnap me after Cub Scouts.",train

Rachel Green,You promised you would break up with her!,train
Chandler Bing,"I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!",train

Monica Geller,What?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight A's, his parents would say, ""Yeah, he pulled a Monica."" Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, ""Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica."" Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, ""Yeah, that one's outta here."" Though some things don't change.",train
Monica Geller,"All right, I'll go down there. But, I'm not gonna serve the lasagna. I'm gonna serve something I make.",train

Joey Tribbiani,What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.,train

Ross Geller,"Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, get out of my kitchen!",train
Chandler Bing,"All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.",train
Phoebe Buffay,All right I... I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.,train

Chandler Bing,"I don't know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.",train

Joey Tribbiani,Five years.,train
Ross Geller,You've sentenced him?!,train

Chandler Bing,What?!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, y'know at first I thought we could talk about this y'know, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I don't think I...",train
Chandler Bing,"Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that I'll stop seeing her?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, it's not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I don't want to live with some one who doesn't know what it is to be a friend. So, I'll see ya.",train
Chandler Bing,"Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!",train
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! You did! And that's why I'm leaving.,train
Chandler Bing,"All right look, if you're not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!",train
Chandler Bing,What?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! But if would've know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much! See you around!",train
Chandler Bing,"All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. What?",train

Monica Geller,"Fine! Judge all you want to but, married a lesbian, left a man at the altar, fell in love with a gay ice dancer, threw a girl's wooden leg in a fire, livin' in a box!!",train
Rachel Green,"So now, what exactly is the point of the box?",train
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler?,train
Chandler Bing,"The meaning of the box is three fold. One , it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two , it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three , it hurts!",train
Ross Geller,"Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?",train
Rachel Green,Why?,train

Rachel Green,"Ooh, I like those sunglasses.",train
Ross Geller,"Like 'em, like 'em? Or, I'd like to get store credit for that amount like 'em?",train
Rachel Green,,train
Monica Geller,"All right everybody, this turkey is ready!",train
Monica Geller,"Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.",train
Rachel Green,Fancy soap? I thought we were savin' that for the Pope!,train
Monica Geller,See he's nice. Right?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, ""That's not how your dad used to do it.""",train
Monica Geller,I saved you a seat.,train
Rachel Green,Sick-sick-sick-sick.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'll get it.",train
Chandler Bing,Gotcha!,train
Joey Tribbiani,That doesn't sound like thinking to me!,train
Chandler Bing,Sorry!,train

Chandler Bing,"Okay, okay, you got it!",train
Rachel Green,"Ross, can you pass me the yams?",train
Ross Geller,"Sure! Oh, and Joey's got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.",train

Rachel Green,"Okay, fine.",train
Chandler Bing,"You can't tell, but I'm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesn't mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise you're just an idiot in a box!",train
Chandler Bing,"You're right, and I'm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I won't say another word tonight.",train
Joey Tribbiani,So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?,train
Chandler Bing,Absolutely!,train
Joey Tribbiani,That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? Okay.,train
Rachel Green,"Don't say that I have no sentiment! This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! This is from the museum from the first time we... were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!",train
Ross Geller,"I don't know what to say, I'm sorry. Though, you're not supposed to take these. It's like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.",train
Monica Geller,"Ooh, this always happens.",train
Monica Geller,Thank you.,train
Monica Geller,Y'know all my friends think this is weird.,train
Monica Geller,"I know! I mean it's like me and your dad, that's a totally separate thing.",train

Joey Tribbiani,Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought you'd be out partying with Gandel-worf.,train
Ross Geller,"It's Gandolf, and he's not coming.",train

Chandler Bing,"Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?",train
Ross Geller,Yeah.,train
Chandler Bing,"Well, those were seals, man.",train
Rachel Green,"Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?",train
Monica Geller,"Okay, the owner of Allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!",train
Rachel Green,"Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but I'm soo happy!",train
Monica Geller,Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!,train
Rachel Green,"Ohh, you've waited soo long.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,train
Rachel Green,"Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.,train
Rachel Green,How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know, it would totally depend on her coloring and... You got the job!!",train
Rachel Green,Yes!!!,train
Monica Geller,You got the job?! Why didn't you tell me?,train

Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! What are you saying?,train
Monica Geller,I got offered the head chef job at Allesandro's.,train
Phoebe Buffay,What?,train
Monica Geller,"It's okay, 'cause y'know what? You don't really need me for the business.",train
Phoebe Buffay,You're the cook! With out you it's just me driving up to people's houses with empty trays and asking for money!,train
Monica Geller,"All right. But umm, I-I-I'll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.",train
Phoebe Buffay,For what? I can't believe this! I gotta get out of here.,train
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, wait a minute!",train
Rachel Green,I'm an assistant buyer!!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, so we'll get a little coffee, and get energized, and we'll head back out.",train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, all right.",train
Ross Geller,Okay.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"So, we're having fun, right?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"We don't need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, we'll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.",train
Ross Geller,I'm kinda beat.,train
Chandler Bing,"Actually, me too.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Are you serious?!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Thank God! I'm exhausted!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, but uh, I don't want to be up too late, so uh, I'll have a decaf.",train
Ross Geller,"Yeah, me too.",train
Chandler Bing,"Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"I can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.",train
Ross Geller,"I'm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, y'know? I used them as mittens, I didn't want to touch a thing in that last place.",train
Ross Geller,How sad are we?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I know.",train
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what? We're not sad, we're not sad, we're just not 21 anymore. Y'know? I'm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!",train
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.,train
Ross Geller,"And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"We're 29, we're not women.",train
Monica Geller,"Ohh, here you are. Y'know, I'm-I'm glad you decided to hear me out.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I'm hearing.",train
Monica Geller,"I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.",train
Phoebe Buffay,What?!,train

Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. That's what you really want. Yeah, I don't want to be the reason you're unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really don't want to be the reason I'm unhappy.",train
Monica Geller,Thank you.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?",train

Rachel Green,Oh my God! How?!,train
Rachel Green,"Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh God.",train

Rachel Green,"Yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us-nothing about an assistant buyer?",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, Sophie, I guess you didn't hear about Joanna...",train

Phoebe Buffay,"No, answer his.",train
Ross Geller,"Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so she'd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.",train
Chandler Bing,Were you so late because you were burring this woman?,train
Ross Geller,"No, I'm getting back down 'cause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but she's like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.",train

Monica Geller,"I would love too, but I can't! I mean I just can't, you know that I'm not good at confrontation.",train
Chandler Bing,"Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, who's boss.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Mon! I'm not doing anything, why don't you fire me?",train

Phoebe Buffay,"If she's no fun, why do you want to date her at all?",train
Ross Geller,"Well, I-I want to give her another chance, y'know? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that was-if she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasn't kidding, she's not fun, she's stupid, and kind of a racist.",train

Monica Geller,"Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?",train

Joey Tribbiani,There's like-there's like 300 bucks in this one!,train
Monica Geller,"Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonight's specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bag-Why is nobody writing these down?",train

Phoebe Buffay,"Well look, you don't really like the one from uptown and you're too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay?

Ross Geller,"Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.",train
Chandler Bing,"Yes, and I was saying the actual words.",train
Monica Geller,"So big deal, so Joey's had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn't mean he's great in bed.",train
Chandler Bing,"We share a wall! So either he's great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.",train

Rachel Green,"Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree like that.",train
Chandler Bing,"Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, y'know, I know where everything goes, it's always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, ""My God! Somebody's killing her in there!""",train

Phoebe Buffay,How? How is your fault?,train
Chandler Bing,"Because, I-I should've called! Y'know if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never would've gone out with Nick, and they would've ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!",train

Rachel Green,"Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Ross's wedding.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!,train
Rachel Green,"It just might be too hard, given the history and all that...",train

Rachel Green,"Well, h-how is this like that?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, let's see, it's not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like y'know a bunch of y'know high school crap that nobody really gives y'know...",train

Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, the stripper stole it.",train
Ross Geller,My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!,train

Ross Geller,"Okay, well, we'll call the company that sent her!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"I did that too! They wouldn't give me her real name or her number. They said, ""If I bothered them again they'd call the police."" I said, ""If you talk to the police, you tell them I'm missing a ring!""",train
Ross Geller,"So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That there's nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-I...",train

Monica Geller,The Bible?!,train
Rachel Green,I don't know!,train

Monica Geller,Some moms do that.,train

Rachel Green,I'm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldn't have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.,train

Rachel Green,Still in love with?!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!,train
Rachel Green,I'm not in love with Ross!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.",train
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, I'm going to Ross's wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, I'm still in love with him! I mean, hey, y'know, I like Ross as much as the next guy, y'know? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesn't mean that-that I'm still in love with him. Y'know? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love him-Ohh! Oh my God! Oh my-why didn't you tell me?!!",train
Phoebe Buffay,We thought you knew!,train
Rachel Green,We?!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!",train
Rachel Green,You all know? Does Ross know?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, Ross doesn't know anything.",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, I can not believe you didn't tell me!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, because we thought you knew!! It's so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, ""Hey, you like things clean."" Or, y'know, ""Hey, Joey, you're gay.""",train
Rachel Green,What?!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, please! She's always got a broom in her hand!",train
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Check this out? Huh? Yeah. That's the stuff. What do you think?,train
Chandler Bing,"Well, I don't have to buy that, ""I'm with stupid"" T-shirt anymore.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I like it. Here you go.",train
Chandler Bing,"All right, look, you're not really gonna buy that are you? Don't you think you've embarrassed me enough for one day?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I embarrass you?",train
Chandler Bing,How can I answer that when I'm pretending I don't know you?,train
Chandler Bing,Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?,train
Chandler Bing,"All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, y'know, you're gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Oh yeah? If you're gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks.,train
Chandler Bing,"Okay, wait. All right, that's it, okay, I'm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"How you doin'? Joey Tribbiani, America.",train
Ross Geller,"Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think we'll be able to find a new place for the wedding.",train
Ross Geller,Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?,train
Ross Geller,She said what?,train
Ross Geller,"Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sister's teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? This isn't right.",train
Ross Geller,I can't ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that?,train
Ross Geller,The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.,train
Ross Geller,No. I'm saying it's now.,train
Ross Geller,There's no 'or' in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!,train
Ross Geller,"No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, please-",train
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,train
Rachel Green,Hi.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"So, did shopping make you feel any better about Ross?",train
Rachel Green,Manhattan does not have enough stores.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I think I can help you get over him.",train
Rachel Green,You can?,train
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.,train
Rachel Green,Um-hmm.,train
Phoebe Buffay,And a small piece of chocolate.,train
Rachel Green,Okay.,train
Phoebe Buffay,And a glass of tepid water.,train
Rachel Green,"Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didn't feel like getting up. Okay, I'm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And you're going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.",train
Rachel Green,I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think he's such a great guy. Here. Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that you're with Ross okay and imagine that you're kissing him. And you're-you're running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross it's some kind of grease, it's-uck! Hah?",train
Rachel Green,"I don't know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and y'know it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, let's try some uh, aversion therapy.",train
Rachel Green,Okay.,train
Phoebe Buffay,Okay?,train
Rachel Green,All right.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"So uh, now look at the picture...",train
Rachel Green,Okay.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, and umm...",train
Rachel Green,Ow!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, how do you feel now?",train
Rachel Green,"Well, I like you less!",train
Chandler Bing,"Well, this is just as boring in England.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,train
Chandler Bing,Hey.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Oh. Sorry!,train
Chandler Bing,"No-no-no, y'know what? I really shouldn't have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasn't cool. And if it makes you feel any better, I've had a really lousy day.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Me too.,train
Chandler Bing,Yeah?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Noo!! I've had the best day ever! Dude, check this out! Now, I'm gonna fastforward past the part with you, 'cause it is boring.",train
Monica Geller,Hey!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Sh-shh-shh!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, so say hi to my friend and tell him that you like the hat.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, Chandler.",train
Chandler Bing,That's... That's was...,train

Monica Geller,Hey!,train
Ross Geller,Hi. I understand you had a little talk with Emily.,train
Monica Geller,"Yes, I did! And you are welcome!",train
Ross Geller,Am I?! And was it your idea to postpone the wedding?!,train
Monica Geller,Umm...,train
Chandler Bing,I'm gonna go to the bathroom.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Wait up!,train
Ross Geller,"Hey-hey, since you're the 'fix-it' lady, here's a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesn't want to have the wedding at all?",train
Monica Geller,She said that?!,train
Ross Geller,Yeah.,train
Monica Geller,Why?!,train
Ross Geller,"I don't know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.",train
Monica Geller,Oh my God. You're even dumber than I am!,train
Ross Geller,Excuse me?,train
Monica Geller,"Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?",train
Ross Geller,I don't know. A month?,train
Monica Geller,"Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. That's what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake , with the little people on top. Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.",train
Ross Geller,"I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.",train
Monica Geller,Sometimes we were.,train
Ross Geller,Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?,train
Monica Geller,Okay.,train
Ross Geller,Come on.,train
Chandler Bing,That was pretty intense huh?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Hey, I hope Ross didn't think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!",train
Chandler Bing,I hope he did!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh! I thought of a good flaw! Ross pops his gum!,train

Joey Tribbiani,"That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, they're having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasn't been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Kinda, but I've just been having way too much fun.",train
Phoebe Buffay,So you're not homesick yet?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I don't think so.",train

Monica Geller,Ohh. And I don't even have a date.,train
Rachel Green,Pheebs?,train
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?,train
Rachel Green,Do you remember where the duck food is?,train

Chandler Bing,Well y'know a lot of those Muppets don't have thumbs.,train
Phoebe Buffay,All I got was a lousy key chain! And by that time I was living in a box. I didn't have keys!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry Pheebs, I just, y'know, I just wanted to do a good deed. Like-like you did with the babies.",train

Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What about you, having those babies for your brother? Talk about selfish!",train
Phoebe Buffay,What-what are you talking about?!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, yeah, it was a really nice thing and all, but it made you feel really good right?",train

Rachel Green,Maybe Joey's right. Maybe all good deeds are selfish.,train
Phoebe Buffay,I will find a selfless good deed! 'Cause I just gave birth to three children and I will not let them be raised in a world where Joey is right!,train
Chandler Bing,"Hey, Monica? Can I ask you a cooking question?",train
Monica Geller,Sure!,train
Chandler Bing,"If you're cooking on the stove, does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than Richard?",train
Rachel Green,Chandler! Is he?,train
Monica Geller,"Well, y'know I-I-I think I'm gonna respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend.",train
Chandler Bing,"Why?! I mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you'd ever had, I'd be going like this.",train
Ross Geller,"All right Emily, as much as I love you, I'm sorry, I can't move to London without Ben.",train
Ross Geller,"Yeah, would you please consider moving here? I mean you were gonna move here anyway, why can't you just do that?",train

Monica Geller,"Yeah! But, he can't not exactly see Emily, I mean that's his wife.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.,train
Chandler Bing,That's true!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but you've known Rachel since High School and you cannot just cut her out of your life.",train

Joey Tribbiani,What?! What good is that gonna do anybody?,train

Monica Geller,"A Magic Eight ball?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, it's not a toy.",train
Ross Geller,"Well, I don't know what else to do. I mean, I either keep my wife and lose one of my-my-my best friends or I keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I'm 30! So-so if anyone has-has a better suggestion, let's hear it! 'Cause I-I got nothing! All right, don't be shy, any suggestion will do. Okay then. Here we go. Magic 8 Ball, should I never see Rachel again? Ask again later. Later is not good enough. Ask again later. What the hell! This is broken! It-it is broken!",train

Joey Tribbiani,And you don't a little good about donating the money?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"No, it sucks. I was saving up to buy a hamster.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"A hamster? What, those things are like 10 bucks.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, not the one I had my eye on.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, look-look, Joey's on TV! Isn't that great? My pledge got Joey on TV! Oh that makes me feel-Oh no!",train

Monica Geller,Keep talking.,train

Monica Geller,"Oh now that-that-that's funny, it seems like Chandler's conference could've been in Connecticut or Vermont.",train
Chandler Bing,I'm not in charge of where the conference is held. Do you want people to think it's a fake conference? It's a real conference.,train

Monica Geller,Hi!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you're back too!",train
Monica Geller,"Yeah. Umm, Chandler can I talk to you outside for a second?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, how was your chef thing?",train

Monica Geller,You're not gonna be phased out!,train
Rachel Green,"Well, of course I am! It's not gonna happen to Ross! He's your brother. He's your old college roommate. Ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group. I just always assumed Phoebe would be the one to go.",train

Monica Geller,"Oh that's cute! We really all enjoyed it. But y'know, it doesn't count.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Count for what?,train
Monica Geller,Count in our heads as-as good Madlibs.,train
Joey Tribbiani,I guess I'm done.,train

Monica Geller,"Wait-wait, guys! If-if we follow the rules, it's still fun and it means something!",train
Rachel Green,Uh-huh!,train
Joey Tribbiani,I think I'm gonna take-off.,train

Joey Tribbiani,I can still hear you!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,train
Chandler Bing,Hello!,train
Monica Geller,"Hey, what's that?",train

Phoebe Buffay,Eeeee--ohh!! God!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Argh-argh!! Ooh, soft. Is this mink?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! Why would my mother send me a fur? Doesn't she know me but at all! Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make!",train

Ross Geller,Hey!,train
Ross Geller,How come? Everybody else does.,train
Monica Geller,What is that?,train
Ross Geller,"Oh, umm, I'm just getting rid of a couple of things.",train

Ross Geller,"Yes, yes it is! No, but it's good it's-Emily thinks we should get all new stuff. Stuff that's just ours, together. Y'know brand new.",train
Monica Geller,"So basically, this is a getting-rid-of-everything-Rachel-ever-used sale.",train
Ross Geller,Touched. Used. Sat on. Sleep on.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, Ross, you're okay with that?",train
Ross Geller,"Look, if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York, I'm sure everything will be fine.",train
Chandler Bing,"Okay, but don't you think this is a little extreme?",train
Ross Geller,After what I did? Can you blame her?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God! You got off easy! When my friend Silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed, she cursed him and turned his thingy green.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"What is he doing? What, Emily, thinks Ross's furniture has got Rachel coodies?",train
Monica Geller,Now calm down Joey.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"No! Everything's gettin' all messed up, y'know? Emily won't let Ross see Rachel, we're not gonna stop seeing Rachel, hence Ross stops seeing us!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.",train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah I know, we're losing Ross, Joey said hence...",train
Monica Geller,"Look, I'm not happy about this either, but y'know if-if Ross says he's happy then we're just gonna have to keep our feelings about Emily to ourselves. Are you cool with that?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"No! But y'know, I'm an actor, I'll act cool.",train
Rachel Green,"Ohh, whoa God! Storage rooms give me the creeps! Monica, come on please hurry up honey! Please?",train
Monica Geller,"Rachel, if you want the little round waffles, you gotta have to wait until I find the little waffle iron.",train
Rachel Green,I want the little round waffles.,train
Monica Geller,"All right. Op, here it is! Right underneath the can of-of bug bomb. I wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison?",train
Rachel Green,"Okay, y'know what? I'll-I'll have toast!",train
Rachel Green,Arghhhh!!!!!!,train
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Fog him! Fog him!,train
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know what I'm gonna do about this coat.,train

Monica Geller,"Don't get too attached, she's having it cremated.",train
Rachel Green,"What? Uhh, Phoebe, honey, honey, I know you're quirky and I get a big kick out of it, we all do actually, but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature! Not nature, fashion!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"This is fashion?! Okay, so to you, death is fashion?! That's really funny. Here's Phoebe umm, sporting uh, y'know, cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know, the steal traps of wintry Russia. I mean, you really thing this looks good? 'Cause I do.",train
Ross Geller,I know I miss you too. I can't wait to see you. I love you. Bye.,train

Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!,train
Chandler Bing,"Look, we just think that maybe she's being a little unreasonable.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Yes! Yes! Unreasonable!,train
Ross Geller,"Unreasonable? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work! All right, it's about compromise! Do you always like it? No! Do you do it? Yes! Because it's not all laughing, happy, candy in the sky, drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time! It's real life, okay? It's what grown-ups do!",train
Phoebe Buffay,I think he's right. You guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much.,train
Monica Geller,"God, I feel so guilty about Ross.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I know.",train
Joey Tribbiani,I kinda feel like it's my fault.,train
Chandler Bing,Kind of? If you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.,train

Rachel Green,Hi!,train
Rachel Green,What? Yeti-I mean Danny?,train

Rachel Green,What?,train
Rachel Green,What? Hey! No-no-no! This not cool! You don't even know me!,train

Rachel Green,"Well, y'know, if-if kids like to play with Capri pants.",train
Rachel Green,And stop saying that! I hate that!,train
Rachel Green,Fine! I judged you. I made a snap judgement. But you did it too! And you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement! You can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong! What does that say about you?,train
Rachel Green,What?!,train
Rachel Green,Okay. Okay.,train
Chandler Bing,"Uh, Ross?",train

Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, if you think Fireball's relaxing, you've obviously have never played.",train

Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Hiya!,train
Rachel Green,"Hey! Hey, cute jacket!",train

Ross Geller,Ohh.,train
Phoebe Buffay,But somehow you came off as the bad guy.,train

Ross Geller,"Ohh, this cake is really good!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay, see? Things are looking up already!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, everyone calm down! Everyone calm down! I have something that I would like to say! Who here likes Ross? Of course you don't like him! He-he didn't give you any money, he raised his own hand when I asked, ""Who hear likes Ross,"" and he's wearing two nametags! I-I'll be honest with you guys, when I first met Ross I didn't like him at all! But then once I got to know him I saw that he's really sweet and caring and very generous. I mean, all I'm saying is don't judge Ross before you get to know him all right? I mean, I like all you guys now, but when I first meet you y'know Kurt, I thought, y'know abrasive drunk, umm Lola, mind numbingly stupid! And okay, you guys Gold-digger, cradle robbing perv! So, I think you all know what I mean.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Obviously I didn't think they were gonna start throwing things. I just thought if I kept insulting everyone, you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero.",train
Ross Geller,"Oh wow, yeah! See, I did not get that.",train
Chandler Bing,Where's Monica?! Where is she? I need to talk to her! It's urgent! Is she here?,train

Chandler Bing,Monica...,train
Monica Geller,"No-no, don't-don't-don't do it!",train
Chandler Bing,Will you marry me?,train
Ross Geller,Oh-no. No. No.,train
Joey Tribbiani,What a bad idea!,train
Rachel Green,"Ohhhh, I cannot look at it!",train
Monica Geller,"Chandler, why are you doing this?",train
Chandler Bing,I don't know. But I know I'm not afraid to do this.,train
Monica Geller,Chandler.,train
Chandler Bing,I'm doing this because I'm sorry?,train
Monica Geller,"Do you umm, you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?",train
Chandler Bing,"No, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry is pretty much fourth y'know, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married. Will you be my wife?",train
Monica Geller,"Chandler, umm, I want you to take just a minute and I want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds.",train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'm kinda wishing everyone wasn't here right now.",train
Monica Geller,Honey! Do you know that none of that stuff came from me?! I mean I never said I wanted to have babies and get married right now!,train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah I know, but I was really confused and then I talked to these guys.",train
Monica Geller,Who? Two divorces and Joey?!,train
Ross Geller,Hey!,train
Joey Tribbiani,She's right y'know.,train
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but still, cheap shot!",train
Monica Geller,"Y'know what? Y'know when I said that I want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own? Well, you're not ready for that.",train
Chandler Bing,I didn't think I was!,train
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, what would have done if I said yes?",train
Chandler Bing,"Well I would've been happy because I would've be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that I love. Or, you would've seen a Chandler shaped hole in that door.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Ross, will you pass me that knife?",train
Ross Geller,"No, I will not!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, it's okay. You don't have to be so mean about it.",train
Ross Geller,"You're right, I'm sorry. Will you marry me?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Aw, and I was gonna ask you to marry me because I forgot to say hello to you last week.",train
Rachel Green,"Oh no wait Pheebs, I think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you. But I'm not sure, Chandler?",train
Chandler Bing,"Okay, how long is this going to go on.",train
Monica Geller,"Well I think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so, a long time.",train
Ross Geller,"This is fun. Hey Rach, remember that whole ""We were on a break thing?"" Well, I'm sorry, will you marry me?",train
Chandler Bing,That's not funny.,train
Joey Tribbiani,That's not funny at all!,train

Monica Geller,Wow!,train
Chandler Bing,"Oh that's so cool! Why would a cop come in here though? They don't serve donuts. Y'know what actually, could you discover the badge again? I think I can come up with something better than that.",train
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, I bet somebody's missing that badge.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I should probably take it back. Ooh, but you know what? While I'm at the police station, I could check their Ten Most Wanted lists because my friend Fritzy has been like number 11 forever, so this could be her year!",train

Monica Geller,Nooo!,train
Rachel Green,I know!,train
Monica Geller,"Well thank God you were here! I mean, we have to erase that!",train
Rachel Green,What?! We can't do that!,train
Monica Geller,"We have too! I mean what if Ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together? Is that what you want? Ross back with that controlling, neurotic, crazy Emily? The Emily that wouldn't let him see you?",train
Rachel Green,Noo! Oh no! No! God no! He should not get back together with her. I know that! You know that! Even Ross knows that! But that still doesn't give us the right to erase his message!,train
Monica Geller,"I'm his sister, okay? I love him! I don't want to see him get hurt! Come on! Doesn't that give me the right to control him-help him?",train
Rachel Green,I don't think he's the one who needs help.,train
Monica Geller,"No, look, she's obviously unstable, okay? I mean she's thinking about running out on her wedding day. Okay, fine! But I mean, look at the position she's putting him in! What's he gonna do? Ross is gonna run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage?! I mean, who would do that?! Okay, fine, all right, but that's y'know, it's different! Although it did involve a lot of the same people.",train
Rachel Green,Ugh!,train
Monica Geller,"Y'know what, this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she's trying to play on him.",train
Rachel Green,"Okay, you are crazy! I'm sorry, but she sounded generally upset! I mean, listen!",train
Rachel Green,Noooooooo!,train
Chandler Bing,"Okay, y'know, we-we're safe right? I mean nothing bad can go down!",train
Ross Geller,What is it?,train
Chandler Bing,"Oh, hurry up. I want to sign that.",train
Ross Geller,What? What? What? What is it?,train

Monica Geller,Oh yeah right!,train
Rachel Green,"No, Monica! Monica! We have to fix this!",train
Monica Geller,There's nothing we can do. You erased the message!,train
Rachel Green,Yeah well unless we tell him.,train
Monica Geller,"Well, if you're gonna be totally rational about this, I can't argue with you! All right? Fine, if you wanna tell him, tell him. I just don't want to be a part of it.",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, maybe that's Emily calling back to leave the exact same message.",train
Ross Geller,"Hey Ross! It's you! I just want you to remember this feeling. You are lucky to be alive! So live everyday to the fullest. Love yourself, okay? Okay. Oh, and also get stamps. Bye!",train
Monica Geller,Wow! Play that message for Emily and this whole problem goes away!,train
Rachel Green,Right?,train
Phoebe Buffay,John Glenn is here?!,train
Ross Geller,"Pheebs, we had the most incredible night! Okay, so, we're in the car...",train
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!,train
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay, so we're in the car. Right? And bang! A shot was fired. And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"My God, Joey!",train
Chandler Bing,It was a car backfire!,train
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but-but he didn't know that!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I didn't know that.",train
Ross Geller,And it could've just as easily have been a bullet.,train
Chandler Bing,Who jumps at loud noises!,train
Ross Geller,Wow! I could've died tonight.,train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life.",train
Ross Geller,I do have a newfound respect for life.,train
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! Sure! Yep! Oh, y'know what? If I heard a shot right now, I'd throw my body on you.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Okay!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Bye!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Dude! How come you took off?,train
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I just went for a walk, around the living room. Whatever...",train
Joey Tribbiani,Is something wrong?,train
Chandler Bing,"No. No I'm just tired. Y'know, from-from the walk.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.,train
Chandler Bing,You dove in front of Ross! Ross!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!",train
Chandler Bing,I do not hate Ross!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.,train
Chandler Bing,What picture?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know, but I don't like what I'm hearing!",train
Chandler Bing,"Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I...knew...you could take care of yourself. Y'know, I mean Ross, he need help. He's not street like us!",train
Chandler Bing,"When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich.",train
Chandler Bing,From a bullet!,train
Joey Tribbiani,I know it doesn't make much sense...,train
Chandler Bing,Much sense?!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Look Chandler, it was instinct! Okay? I just went for it!",train
Chandler Bing,"So you risked your life, for a sandwich!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"I know it sounds crazy, but Chandler this is the greatest sandwich in the world!",train
Chandler Bing,"So you didn't uh, choose Ross before me.",train
Joey Tribbiani,No! I would never do that! You-you're like my brother!,train
Chandler Bing,Really?!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! In fact, to prove how much you mean to me, here.",train
Chandler Bing,Thanks.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"No, eh, oh-oi, easy, it's not a hot dog!",train
Joey Tribbiani,How good is that?,train
Chandler Bing,"Oh-oi-ho, yeah!",train
Joey Tribbiani,See?,train
Chandler Bing,Hm-hmm.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-whoa-hey, dude, what are you doing?!",train
Chandler Bing,I thought you were showing me how much you mean to me.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. With a bite! Gee-e-e-eez!,train
Rachel Green,Hey! Hi!,train
Ross Geller,"Rach, what uh, what are you doing here?",train
Rachel Green,"Hey! Y'know what? You are in our apartment all the time! Okay? This is, this is just a drop in the bucket mister!",train
Ross Geller,"Y'know, it-it doesn't matter. The important thing is that you're here. You're my friend, and you're here. Oh!",train
Rachel Green,"Okay, just a little scared. What's going on Ross?",train
Ross Geller,The most amazing thing happened tonight. I thought my number was up. I had an actual near death experience!,train
Rachel Green,What?! What? What happened?!,train
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay, we were on the ride along with Gary, right?",train
Rachel Green,Yeah!,train
Ross Geller,And somebody took a shot at me!,train
Rachel Green,Really?!,train
Ross Geller,"No, a car backfired, but I thought somebody was taking a shot at me. And Rach, I...I survived! And I was filled with this-this great respect for life. Y'know? I-I want to experience every moment. I want to seize every opportunity. I-I am seeing everything so-so clearly now.",train
Rachel Green,Because a car backfired?,train
Ross Geller,"Okay, why are you here?",train
Rachel Green,"Well, I-I-I don't know how this fits into your whole ""seizing"" thing but um, Emily called you today.",train
Ross Geller,You talked to her?,train
Rachel Green,"No, she left a message. But it-it kinda got erased. There's just something wrong with your machine.",train
Ross Geller,"Well, okay, what-what did she say?",train
Rachel Green,"Well, uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh, she wants you to call her.",train
Ross Geller,Wow!,train
Rachel Green,"Now, that-that was a good thing that I told you, right?",train
Ross Geller,"Huh? Yeah! Yes, of course!",train
Rachel Green,"Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Because-I'm sorry, all right. Because y'know what? She didn't want me-not important. The point is, I was right. Your decision. Okay? I was right. Your decision.",train
Ross Geller,"Right. I guess, I guess I should call Emily.",train
Rachel Green,"Okay, no, that's not the right decision. That's not, that's not right, no Ross-Ross, come on! I mean, that woman made you miserable! Okay, Ross, do you really want to get back into that?",train
Ross Geller,"Okay, look, yesterday I would've even considered calling her back, but my ex-wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience. I mean, that-that has got to mean something!",train
Rachel Green,"Ugh, Ross! That was not a near death experience! That was barely an experience!",train
Ross Geller,"You weren't there! Okay, maybe this is something that I-I'm supposed to seize! Y'know?",train
Rachel Green,"Okay, y'know what? Maybe, this is not about seizing stuff. Maybe this is about escaping stuff.",train
Ross Geller,Huh.,train
Rachel Green,"I mean, look-look today you escaped death, y'know? And maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with Emily?",train
Ross Geller,"That does make sense. Because I do wanna seize some opportunity, but I-I really don't wanna see or talk to her.",train
Rachel Green,"Well, there you go!",train
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Maybe today is just, close call day.",train
Rachel Green,Close call day.,train
Ross Geller,"Hey, thanks Rach.",train
Rachel Green,"Ohh, honey no problem. Okay.",train
Ross Geller,Oh wait-wait-wait! The message is blinking. Maybe you didn't erase it.,train
Rachel Green,Oh?,train
Ross Geller,"""Hey Ross, it's you!"" Oh yeah, no that's-that's an old message, nobody needs to hear that.",train
Rachel Green,No.,train
Ross Geller,"Hey umm, was-was Monica here?",train
Rachel Green,Yeah.,train
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I want my money back.",train
Rachel Green,"Yeah, uh you-you probably need that for stamps, right?",train
Ross Geller,"Hey Pheebs, has Gary ever been shot at for real?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes. Once. Yeah, a little. He kinda did it to himself. It's not really a good story.",train
Ross Geller,"I wonder how I would react under fire, y'know? And not backfire but-but heavy fire, like I was in a war or something.",train
Monica Geller,"Man, I would be great in a war! I mean, I really, I think I would make a fantastic military leader. I mean I know I would make General way before any of you guys.",train
Chandler Bing,Before or after you were shot by your own troops?,train
Ross Geller,I know where Joey would be. He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us.,train
Chandler Bing,"Yes, if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, hero sandwiches.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Well you all know that I'm a pacifist so I'm not interested in war in any way. But y'know what? When the revolution comes, I will have to destroy you all. Not you Joey.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm fine, thanks.",train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, see, I can't pull of baby-doll can I?",train
Monica Geller,No. I think we learned that from the sugarlips incident. I'm gonna get some tea.,train
Chandler Bing,Okay.,train
Chandler Bing,Hiya doin' pumpkin?,train
Phoebe Buffay,Nope.,train
Monica Geller,"So it looks like it's going really well for you two, huh?",train
Monica Geller,Oh my God!,train
Monica Geller,I think that is so great! When are you gonna ask her?,train
Monica Geller,"I swear, I promise. I promise. Oh my God, I'm so excited! {And I just can't hide it! I'm about to lose control and I think I like it! Sorry, just couldn't resist it.} All right, listen let me tell you, do not get her flowers. Okay? Because y'know, she cries when they die, and there's the whole funeral...",train
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. Bye!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"So, what movie should we see?",train
Monica Geller,Gary's gonna ask you to move in with him!!,train
Phoebe Buffay,What?! Really?!,train
Monica Geller,"He just told me at the counter. He made me promise not to tell, but I couldn't hold it in any longer!",train
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe this!,train
Chandler Bing,"Right, because it's fast. Because, it's so fast. It's fast!",train
Monica Geller,Relax! It's Phoebe! Not you!,train
Chandler Bing,"Oh! Good for you Pheebs, way to go!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"No, but it is fast. Isn't it?",train
Monica Geller,Ohhhh!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I like him a lot but I don't think I'm ready for this!",train
Chandler Bing,"So, what are you gonna do?",train
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know. I'll just handle it-I'll ask you to talk to him!,train
Chandler Bing,Me?! Why me?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Because you are so afraid of commitment! You talk to him, make him scared like you! Make him a...man!",train
Chandler Bing,"I'll try, but I'm not sure what good it would do, y'know? Because I'm a lot less afraid of commitment than I used to be.",train
Monica Geller,That is so sweet!,train
Chandler Bing,"Still terrified, I'll take care of it. No problem.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Ross, is uh, is Staten Island really an island?",train
Ross Geller,"Uh-huh, that's why they call it Staten Island.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Ohhh. I thought it was like Long Island.,train
Ross Geller,Also an island.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, what time is it?",train
Ross Geller,2:17.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow! You realize that we've been throwing this ball, without dropping it, for like an hour?",train
Ross Geller,Are you serious?!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. I realized it about a half-hour ago but I didn't want to say anything 'cause I didn't want to jinx it.,train
Ross Geller,Wow! We are pretty good at this! Hey! We totally forgot about lunch!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I-I, I think that's the first time I ever missed a meal! Yeah, my pants are a little loose!",train
Rachel Green,"Hey, you guys...",train
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,train
Rachel Green,Is Monica here?,train
Rachel Green,"All right listen umm, I just bought something I'm not sure she's gonna like it, and it's gonna seem a little crazy, but this is something that I wanted since I was a little girl.",train
Ross Geller,You bought Shawn Cassidy!,train
Rachel Green,"Noo! I wish! Okay, you ready?",train

Rachel Green,"Well, it was a little extravagant, but I a pretty good deal.",train
Ross Geller,Yeah? How much?,train
Rachel Green,A thousand bucks.,train
Ross Geller,ON A CAT??!!!!,train
Joey Tribbiani,It's not a cat!,train
Rachel Green,"All right listen ball boys! My grandmother had one of these when I was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing! I mean it was so cute, it would sit in my lap and purr all day long, and I would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it!",train
Ross Geller,"Free cats do that too, y'know. {Which reminds me, if I might get a little political here, support your local animal shelter. Pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from, you get a much better deal from the shelter, plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half. If you want a leash, go to the pet shop. If you want the dog for that leash, go to the shelter and save it's life. Now back to regularly scheduled programming.}",train
Joey Tribbiani,It's not a cat!,train
Rachel Green,"Ugh! Look you guys, I'm really excited about this! Okay? I don't care what you think! I'm gonna go set up a little litter box for Mrs. Whiskerson. Well, what am I gonna call her? Fluffy?!",train
Ross Geller,"Hey, you wanna get something to eat or uh, do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth? Huh?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhh, the ball thing.",train
Ross Geller,Yeah?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Ross, wouldn't it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it?!",train
Ross Geller,"Uhh, yeah it would! Let's do it!",train
Joey Tribbiani,Okay!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Uh-oh.,train
Ross Geller,What?,train
Joey Tribbiani,I have to pee. And Rachel's in the bathroom!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, I didn't think we were gonna make it!",train
Ross Geller,"I know! Don't switch hands, okay?",train
Chandler Bing,Hey ladies! What are you in here for?,train
Chandler Bing,"Gary, I'm here to report a crime.",train
Chandler Bing,It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.,train
Chandler Bing,"Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk. Man to uh, me.",train
Chandler Bing,"Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!",train
Chandler Bing,You mean scared.,train
Chandler Bing,Scared? Happy?,train
Chandler Bing,"I am trying to open your eyes, my man! Don't you see, if you lived with Phoebe she's always gonna be there. You're gonna get home, she's there. You go to bed, she's there. You wake up and oh yes, she's there!",train
Chandler Bing,"Were you're parents happy, or something?",train
Chandler Bing,"Wow, y'know when you say it, it doesn't sound so scary.",train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I think I do! Y'know what? You move in with her! You move in with her right now! Maybe I should in with Monica!",train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, you're right about that.",train
Ross Geller,...now when they found the remains of the Mesozoic Mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a Paleozoic Amphibian in its jaws! How did it get there?!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.,train
Monica Geller,Hey guys!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Hi!,train
Monica Geller,"Joey, I left my watch on the counter last night. It was right here, where is it?",train
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know.,train
Monica Geller,"All right, come on, I'm-I'm late for work!",train
Ross Geller,How do you know? You don't have a watch.,train
Monica Geller,"Guys, could you please just stop throwing the ball for one minute and just help me find it!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I don't know.... Yeah, can't do it.",train
Monica Geller,What?!,train
Ross Geller,"Monica, whatever you do, do not drop that ball!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, we haven't dropped it in...",train
Ross Geller,"2 hours, 27 minutes.",train
Monica Geller,Really?!,train
Monica Geller,"I-I'm not gonna be able to make it into work today, I don't feel very good. Yes!! Wow! Uh, for a second there I thought I was really better, but I'm not.",train
Ross Geller,Hey Rach!,train
Rachel Green,Hey.,train
Ross Geller,Check it out! Almost 3 hours without droppin' it!,train
Rachel Green,"Oh, wow! Congratulations, that's quite a waste of time.",train
Monica Geller,Rach?,train
Rachel Green,Yeah?,train
Monica Geller,"You have scratches all over you, what happened?",train
Rachel Green,"Well, it's my cat.",train
Monica Geller,What?!,train
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, I got a cat.",train
Monica Geller,I don't want a cat!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, don't worry, it's not a cat.",train
Ross Geller,Yeah.,train
Rachel Green,"You guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat. I mean, it's not sweet, it's not cute, I even dragged that little string on the ground, and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me. And I swear, I know this sounds crazy, but every time this cat hisses at me I know it's saying, ""Rachel!""",train
Ross Geller,Doesn't sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat.,train
Monica Geller,What?! You paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300!!,train
Rachel Green,"Well, I was gonna let you play with it.",train
Chandler Bing,Hi!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Hmm, did you talk to Gary about the moving in thing?",train
Chandler Bing,"Yes I did, and I think you should do it.",train
Phoebe Buffay,What?!,train
Chandler Bing,"He's a great guy, y'know? And he loves you a lot, you are a very lucky lady.",train
Phoebe Buffay,You are useless! Freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do! The one thing! And you can't even do that right! God!,train
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry. If you ask me, I'd move in with him.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh!! God! Ooh! Get out of here, good for nothing.",train
Chandler Bing,Hey Gar!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! Okay.,train
Phoebe Buffay,Thanks! Okay.,train
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?,train
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-hmm.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"No that's not true. If you're not moving forward, you're just staying still. And staying still is good. Watch this.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?,train
Phoebe Buffay,That is so sweet. But don't you think it's a little too soon? I mean there's so much we don't know about each other.,train
Phoebe Buffay,I just-I don't want us to jump into something we're not ready for.,train
Phoebe Buffay,I really don't want to mess up what we have. I'm just-I'm worried it's gonna be a big mistake.,train
Phoebe Buffay,Which is why my answer is yes!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh! I'm so...happy.,train
Ross Geller,Monica! Stop throwing it so hard! We're on the same team!,train
Chandler Bing,Four hours? You guys have been doing this for four hours?,train
Joey Tribbiani,That's right baby.,train
Chandler Bing,"All right, let me in.",train
Monica Geller,No-no! Don't do it! Don't!,train
Chandler Bing,What?,train
Monica Geller,He's a dropper!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, that's right!",train
Chandler Bing,I'm not a dropper!,train
Ross Geller,"It's really a uh-uh three person game, y'know?",train
Chandler Bing,It's throwing and catching!,train
Ross Geller,All right.,train
Chandler Bing,Oh! Oh! That's so hard.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa-whoa you guys, it's not a cat!",train
Monica Geller,Oh my-Oh good God!,train
Rachel Green,"I give up you guys, I don't know what I'm going to do with this thing!",train
Ross Geller,"Baking it didn't help, huh?",train
Monica Geller,"So, why don't you just take it back to where you got it?",train
Rachel Green,I tried! They won't take her back.,train
Chandler Bing,Maybe that's because she's a minion of the anti-Christ.,train

Third marriage, well they really shouldn't allow you to get married when you're that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevada's fault.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldn't be interested? Who wouldn't want to date him?",train

Ross Geller,"Look, I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just don't want to be divorced three times.",train

Ross Geller,"Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-I'll go to my lawyer's office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Noth--Nothing!!",train
Chandler Bing,"Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?",train

Chandler Bing,"Look, I'm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah but we won't be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.,train
Chandler Bing,Not once did we do that.,train
Monica Geller,Hi.,train
Chandler Bing,Hey!,train

Chandler Bing,And you're upset because you didn't make your best friend cry?,train
Monica Geller,"I mean, all I'm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Don't I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!",train

Chandler Bing,"Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!",train
Ross Geller,Yes.,train
Ross Geller,"Yes, second in two years. Third overall.",train
Ross Geller,"Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunk...",train
Ross Geller,"Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.",train
Ross Geller,This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.,train
Ross Geller,I think just the annulment for today.,train
Ross Geller,Easy.,train
Ross Geller,No problem.,train
Ross Geller,"Ooh! There's no way to do this without her? 'Cause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.",train
Ross Geller,"Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? I will think about the therapy.",train
Rachel Green,Hey!,train
Monica Geller,"Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.",train
Rachel Green,Okay!,train
Monica Geller,"Y'know, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.",train
Rachel Green,Okay.,train
Monica Geller,"Hey Rach, what about this? Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I don't know if I want it because it might be y'know, too many memories!",train
Rachel Green,What the hell is that?,train
Monica Geller,"I don't know. Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.",train
Rachel Green,"Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!",train
Monica Geller,Something to remember me by!,train

Monica Geller,"But still, it's a big change. The end of an era, you might say!",train
Rachel Green,Are you okay? You're not blinking.,train
Monica Geller,"I'm fine! I just, I'm thinking how much it's an end of era.",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, all right. But y'know I gotta say, I don't, I don't think six years counts as an era.",train
Monica Geller,"An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasn't significant to you!",train
Rachel Green,What is the matter with you?!,train
Monica Geller,What is the matter with you?!! Why aren't you more upset?! Aren't you gonna be sad that we're not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean aren't you gonna miss me at all?!,train
Rachel Green,"All right, fine, but don't get mad at me. It's-it's just a little hard to believe.",train
Monica Geller,What's hard to believe?,train
Rachel Green,"Well y'know, it's you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Y'know? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess I'm not upset because I don't see you guys going through with it. I'm sorry.",train
Monica Geller,"Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.",train
Rachel Green,But I...,train
Monica Geller,"No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.",train
Rachel Green,It is? Really?,train
Monica Geller,"Yeah, sweetie.",train
Rachel Green,"I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?",train

Monica Geller,I know!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, bye!",train
Ross Geller,Oh no.,train
Phoebe Buffay,So? Did you get the annulment?,train
Ross Geller,I couldn't.,train
Phoebe Buffay,I knew it! Because you love Rachel.,train
Ross Geller,It's not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than I...,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, complicated 'cause of the love.",train
Ross Geller,"I... I do, I do not love Rachel. I'm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?",train
Phoebe Buffay,I've never been more convinced of your love for her.,train
Ross Geller,I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?!,train
Ross Geller,"Ohh, what's wrong?!",train
Rachel Green,Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.,train
Ross Geller,Oh my-Come here! Come here! It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay.,train

Ross Geller,Of course.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?",train

Joey Tribbiani,"Really?! Well, when?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it won't work out.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Wow.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"I know. Then, I'm gonna marry Chandler for the money and you'll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Great!,train
Phoebe Buffay,But then we ditch those two and that's when we get married. We'll have Chandler's money and Rachel's kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachel's drinking problem.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh-oh, what about Ross?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.",train
Chandler Bing,Hey!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Dude! What are yo-you trying to kill me?!,train
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh, what?",train
Rachel Green,Well since I'm movin' out and-and you're so beautiful...,train
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!,train
Rachel Green,...how about I move in with you?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?",train
Monica Geller,Who's Denise?,train
Phoebe Buffay,My roommate.,train
Rachel Green,You have a roommate?!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, Denise. Denise!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?",train
Chandler Bing,"Pheebs, I don't understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?",train
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Rach, listen I was thinkin' uh, I'm gonna have an extra room over at my place...",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, that's true.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursday's right?",train
Rachel Green,"Yeah, yeah I think I'm gonna find my own place.",train
Chandler Bing,Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursday's was just our thing man!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.,train
Ross Geller,Hey!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?",train
Ross Geller,"Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.",train
Phoebe Buffay,You didn't tell her did you?,train
Ross Geller,No.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Of course not, because you're in love with her.",train
Ross Geller,"I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didn't tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"What do you mean, comforted her?",train
Ross Geller,"It's nothing, I just gave her a hug.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!",train
Ross Geller,It's also a sign of friendship.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson.",train
Ross Geller,It was a hug!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?",train
Ross Geller,S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Ninety percent of a women's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why, that's why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! Oh come on Ross, you're a scientist.",train
Ross Geller,"I was hugging her as a friend. It's not my fault her-her hair got in my face, she's got a lot of it and it smells all-all uh...coconutty. What?! Oh, that doesn't mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachel's not in the same place you are.",train
Ross Geller,"If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I didn't understand that, but y'know, maybe that's 'cause you were speaking the secret language of love!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Dude, some guy just called for you.",train
Chandler Bing,Who was it?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know! How about, ""Thanks for taking the message."" Jeez!",train
Monica Geller,"Okay listen, y'know when you move in Rachel's room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?",train
Chandler Bing,Sure!,train
Monica Geller,"Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really haven't thought about it that much.",train
Chandler Bing,"Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, y'know? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!",train
Monica Geller,No.,train
Chandler Bing,"Okay so you mean no as in, ""Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Let's discuss it before we reject it completely.""",train
Monica Geller,"Oh, I'm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.",train
Chandler Bing,"So, that's it?",train
Monica Geller,I just don't think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.,train
Chandler Bing,Which is why Asteroids is perfect! It's the oldest game!,train
Monica Geller,What do you have against the beautiful guest room?,train
Chandler Bing,"I don't have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!",train
Monica Geller,Are you mocking me?,train
Chandler Bing,"No, I'm not mocking you, or you beautiful guest room.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, what's up?",train
Chandler Bing,"Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today.",train
Chandler Bing,"""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" Nice!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah? I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me. And what's more different than me; a guy who's not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? Not just a hat rack my friend!",train
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, I have to ask you...",train
Phoebe Buffay,Shhhhhh! I'm swamped right now.,train
Rachel Green,You're just staring into space.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, I'm trying to move that pencil.",train
Rachel Green,This one?,train
Phoebe Buffay,It worked!,train
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; ""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" It's just, there is nothing! The city's full!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait, no, look at this! ""Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okay..."" Oh, yeah, but it's on the ground floor.",train
Ross Geller,Hey!,train
Rachel Green,Hey.,train
Ross Geller,"Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?",train
Rachel Green,Yeah! Why?,train
Ross Geller,"Okay, there's this guy, Warren, from the museum and he's going on a dig for like two years and he's got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?",train
Rachel Green,That sounds great! I'd love to live at Warren's!! I love Warren! Thank you!,train
Ross Geller,"Don't thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. Here's Warren's number.",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! Oh, thank you!",train
Ross Geller,"Okay, you go grab it!",train
Phoebe Buffay,I saw it.,train
Ross Geller,I don't know what you're talking about.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, I'm talking about that which you already know but won't admit. You love her again; you re-love her!",train
Ross Geller,"Look, I do not re-love her.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"I can't believe you won't just admit it! Okay, just promise me that you won't do anything stupid.",train
Ross Geller,"Look, we're just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?",train
Rachel Green,"Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. I'm never gonna find anything.",train
Ross Geller,You can live with me.,train
Rachel Green,What?!,train
Phoebe Buffay,What?!,train
Ross Geller,What?,train
Rachel Green,Oh my God! Are you serious?!,train
Ross Geller,Uh-huh.,train
Rachel Green,I would love to live with you Ross; that's-that's great! Thank you!,train
Ross Geller,"Well, I'm-I'm just glad I could, y'know, help you out.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! I'm-I'm so happy for you guys. This is so-so, not stupid.",train
Rachel Green,"Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! You're my hero!",train
Ross Geller,"Hero, I uh, I don't know-well, all right.",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has!",train
Ross Geller,"Oh please! You're gonna say things now, aren't ya?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"No. No, I won't. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn't love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And that's how she ended up living with me! Okay, that's a lie.",train
Chandler Bing,Hi.,train
Monica Geller,Hi.,train
Chandler Bing,"Hi, listen, I'm sorry about before. I don't need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldn't get girls, and now I can 'em-Now, I have you. Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see women...",train
Monica Geller,Stop it Chandler. I'm sorry too.,train
Chandler Bing,Really?,train
Monica Geller,Yeah! Oh yes!,train
Chandler Bing,Ohh.,train
Monica Geller,"Listen, we don't have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.",train
Chandler Bing,That's a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.,train
Monica Geller,Totally!,train
Chandler Bing,We don't have to come up with this now.,train
Monica Geller,Oh good.,train
Chandler Bing,"Hey, y'know what? Why don't we think about changes we can make in the living room?",train
Monica Geller,Changes?,train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I mean we're gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair.",train
Monica Geller,You're-you're-you're gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?,train
Chandler Bing,Is that a problem?,train
Monica Geller,"Well, it's a set and they should probably stay together.",train
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that's cool. Then I'll just bring them both over.",train
Monica Geller,See now-now you're taking them away from their home.,train
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! I'll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!",train
Monica Geller,"Yeah-yeah, y'know what? Yeah, that's it-that's it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! That's-that's what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! I'm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesn't match! Where is it gonna go?!",train
Chandler Bing,In the game room!,train
Monica Geller,Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!,train
Chandler Bing,All right! That's fine! That's fine! I won't bring over the chairs! I won't bring anything over! I wouldn't want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandma's place!!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Everything on your application looks really good-Ohh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa!! Now look, don't be just blurtin' stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?",train
Chandler Bing,You can call off the roommate search! Hi! I'll be living here.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh don't listen to him, he's just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I don't think he's gonna get it.",train
Chandler Bing,Why did you take the shower curtain down?,train
Joey Tribbiani,That thing was a hazard! I'm very safety conscious.,train
Rachel Green,Hey!,train
Ross Geller,"Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.",train
Rachel Green,"Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica's and she and Chandler had a big fight and they're not moving in.",train
Ross Geller,"What do you mean, they're not moving in? They-they're still moving in right?",train
Rachel Green,"No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.",train
Ross Geller,What?! Over a stupid room!,train
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I'm also really psyched 'cause I don't have to move in here!",train
Ross Geller,"Oh no, yeah no, that part's great!",train
Ross Geller,"What's all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!",train
Monica Geller,"Ross, we can handle this.",train
Ross Geller,"Well, apparently not, and I can't just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!",train
Chandler Bing,"Well, why don't you tell her to stop being silly!",train
Ross Geller,"Okay-okay! Two very good points, look I've known you both a long time, and I've never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you've been since you've got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?",train
Chandler Bing,"Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.",train
Monica Geller,Love is the best medicine.,train
Chandler Bing,That's laughter.,train
Monica Geller,Why do you do it?,train
Chandler Bing,I don't know.,train
Ross Geller,"Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?",train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I do.",train
Ross Geller,"And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, don't ya?",train
Monica Geller,Yes.,train
Ross Geller,Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York!,train
Rachel Green,"No-no, I'm staying put.",train
Rachel Green,"Why, where are you going?",train
Ross Geller,Hey Rach!,train
Rachel Green,Hi!,train
Ross Geller,"You're never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. That's great news right-I mean for them. Right?",train
Rachel Green,Oh wow.,train
Ross Geller,"Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.",train
Rachel Green,"Yeah. Y'know umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but don't you think it's gonna be weird?",train
Ross Geller,"Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?",train
Rachel Green,"Well, because of us! Because of our history.",train
Ross Geller,No!,train
Rachel Green,No?,train
Ross Geller,"No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?",train
Rachel Green,No! Not at all!,train
Ross Geller,Good! Me neither! So it's not a problem. We're just two friends who happen to be roommates.,train
Rachel Green,"Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.",train
Ross Geller,Really?! We are?,train
Rachel Green,"Yeah! I'm gonna have a boyfriend, you're gonna have a girlfriend...",train
Ross Geller,Ohh! That would be great.,train
Rachel Green,"But y'know what, if you think it's gonna be okay we'll just work out a system. Y'know, it'll be like college, I'll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, ""Come back later, I'm gettin' lucky.""",train
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I didn't think of that.",train
Ross Geller,So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean it's a really big step! And-and what's the rush?!,train
Monica Geller,That's very funny!,train
Chandler Bing,"He's being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!",train
Ross Geller,"No, I-I-I'm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing y'know you break up!",train
Monica Geller,"Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.",train
Ross Geller,"Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isn't about the room, this is about what the room...represents! And unfortunately, this room could destroy you!!",train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'm not so worried.",train
Monica Geller,"Yeah, no, me neither.",train
Ross Geller,"Fine! It's your life! I just don't want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, but that's what you want, there's nothing I can do. DON'T DO IT!!!!!",train
Monica Geller,You still want to move in together right?,train
Chandler Bing,Of course!,train
Monica Geller,Ross didn't scare you?,train
Chandler Bing,Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.,train
Monica Geller,"Come here, I want to show you something!",train
Chandler Bing,Okay!,train
Chandler Bing,Oh my God! Someone's killed Square Man!,train
Monica Geller,This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and it's still walking distance to the kitchen.,train
Chandler Bing,Oh that's so sweet! I want to show you something too!,train
Monica Geller,Okay!,train
Chandler Bing,"Y'know those big-big uh, road signs that say ""Merge?""",train
Monica Geller,Uh-hmm.,train

Joey Tribbiani,"Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I don't want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, I'm thinking I'll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,train
Chandler Bing,Hey.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,train

Chandler Bing,"Glass, sand, whatever.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.",train

Phoebe Buffay,I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!,train
Monica Geller,But my apartment!,train

Chandler Bing,"Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!",train

Ross Geller,Congratulations.,train
Rachel Green,"Okay Ross, we're-wait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.",train
Ross Geller,What?,train
Rachel Green,"Well, y'know this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.",train
Ross Geller,Excuse me?,train
Rachel Green,"Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?",train
Ross Geller,Yeah?,train
Rachel Green,"And uh, yeah, I didn't really, I didn't want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.",train
Ross Geller,"So then if-if-I mean if you think about it, this is all your fault.",train
Rachel Green,"Yeah, don't push it though.",train
Ross Geller,"I've got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.",train
Rachel Green,"I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldn't be a secret, and we wouldn't have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.",train
Ross Geller,"Did I, did I even treat?",train
Rachel Green,"No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.",train
Ross Geller,That may be the most depressing thing I've heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyer's office.,train

Phoebe Buffay,So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?,train
Chandler Bing,"No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldn't take it.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, how much do you think he needs?",train
Chandler Bing,"I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, y'know? But I have to trick him into taking it so I won't hurt his pride.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Why don't you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.,train
Chandler Bing,Well that would help the pride thing.,train
Monica Geller,Hey!,train
Chandler Bing,Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?,train
Monica Geller,Okay.,train
Chandler Bing,"Okay! So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?",train

Rachel Green,"I'm sorry Pheebs, I guess I'm just really said that I'm leaving.",train
Monica Geller,I'm gonna miss you so much.,train

Monica Geller,I don't think there's anything.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on, there's gotta be something.",train
Monica Geller,"Nope, she's perfect.",train

Monica Geller,"Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.",train
Chandler Bing,"Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",train
Monica Geller,"It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?",train
Chandler Bing,Do you want me to be afraid of you?,train

Chandler Bing,Why wouldn't they be happy?,train
Monica Geller,"Well, um, because mainly, um, they don't like you. I'm sorry.",train

Chandler Bing,Is this why they don't like me or why you don't like me?,train
Monica Geller,"Look, I know that I should've told them. I know I shouldn't care what they think. I'm sorry.",train

Chandler Bing,"I dunno what it is, it just doesn't quite feel like Christmas to me.",train
Monica Geller,"Oh, here.",train

Rachel Green,"So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.",train

Phoebe Buffay,I guess it was kinda funny.,train
Monica Geller,It wasn't funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didn't you pick me?,train
Phoebe Buffay,Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that you're ... just ... kinda high maintenance-Okay let's go to lunch!,train
Monica Geller,"That is completely untrue. You think I'm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and we're going to go through it point by point!",train

Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, man, I could totally get that part. 'I'm sorry, that seat is taken.'",train
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, I didn't mean you. But, you believed me, huh?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"So, you'd hire me, right?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.",train

Monica Geller,"Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?",train
Chandler Bing,Can I finish my story?!,train
Monica Geller,Do you want me to pick you?!,train
Ross Geller,"See, I would never snap at you like that.",train
Monica Geller,Continue.,train
Chandler Bing,"So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steve's doctor's name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, 'Doctor Monkey?' And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up.",train
Ross Geller,"Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, I'm a doctor, and I had a monkey. I'm Doctor Monkey!",train
Chandler Bing,I'm not arguing with that.,train
Monica Geller,"All right, I've heard enough. I've made my decision.",train
Monica Geller,"You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and it's offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldn't be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!",train
Ross Geller,It's your joke.,train
Chandler Bing,Is not.,train
Monica Geller,"Hi, Chandler. There you are.",train
Chandler Bing,"Hi, oh hi.",train
Monica Geller,"Hey, it's Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why don't you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?",train
Chandler Bing,"Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and--generosity of spirit.",train
Rachel Green,"Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think I've ever heard.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Really? I've heard better.,train
Monica Geller,"Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.",train
Chandler Bing,I'm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?,train
Monica Geller,"Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!",train
Chandler Bing,You're a little high maintenance.,train
Monica Geller,Ahhh! You are on my list.,train
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry. You're not easy-going, but you're passionate, and that's good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that I'm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And that's good too. So, they can say that you're high maintenance, but it's okay, because I like ... maintaining you.",train
Monica Geller,I didn't even tell him to say that. . All right you're off my list.,train
Chandler Bing,I'm off the list.,train
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, it's okay that you don't want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know, suddenly I find you very attractive.",train
Chandler Bing,"Hey, buddy boy, how'd the audition go?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Not good, no. I didn't get the part, and I lost my job here, so ...",train
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! That is a bad audition.,train
Rachel Green,How-how did you lose your job here?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.",train
Rachel Green,"He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you've been working here two days? That's not, that's not right.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, what are ya gonna do?",train
Rachel Green,"Joey, you can't let him get away with that. Ya know what, I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'm going to say something to him-No, I really shouldn't say anything-No, I should say something to him. Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire him...",train
Rachel Green,What?,train
Rachel Green,"That's right, he can have his job back. I'm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.",train
Joey Tribbiani,That's great. Thanks Rach.,train
Rachel Green,"Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now who's a pushover?",train

Monica Geller,I have not been sick in over three years!,train
Chandler Bing,I'm gonna grab you some tissue.,train

Rachel Green,I'm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!,train

Chandler Bing,Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.,train

Monica Geller,"I won't care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here.",train
Chandler Bing,Yeah?,train
Monica Geller,"Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don't cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it won't matter to me.",train
Chandler Bing,"Okay, well I won't uh, worry about this anymore then.",train

Rachel Green,Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!,train
Ross Geller,So that's the only reason she could be here huh? It couldn't have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe I'm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!,train
Rachel Green,"Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!",train
Ross Geller,"Y'know what? I think I can take care of myself, I'll talk to you later. Good-bye. Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that you're just using me.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,train

Joey Tribbiani,Nice!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Um-mmm, and I won't have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"That's great, but isn't it gonna bother that people still think you're a porn star?",train
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.,train
Joey Tribbiani,You do?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. You're trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, I'll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! See?",train

Chandler Bing,Maybe we should give them some privacy.,train
Monica Geller,Shhhh!!!,train
Ross Geller,"Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?",train

Rachel Green,Yeah that's right you weren't thinking! Y'know what? Let me give you something to think about!,train
Ross Geller,Oh wait-hold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.,train
Rachel Green,"Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister's mouth long enough to tell me that.",train
Ross Geller,Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!,train
Rachel Green,What?!,train
Ross Geller,"No, I mean, look I don't know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I don't want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.",train
Rachel Green,"Wow. I, I don't even know what to say. Thank you.",train
Ross Geller,You're welcome.,train
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Are-are you crying?,train

Joey Tribbiani,What is the matter with you?!,train
Phoebe Buffay,No! Barry and Mindy.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. Who-who's Barry and Mindy?",train
Rachel Green,Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Ohh-oh, wasn't he cheating on you with her?",train
Rachel Green,"Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.",train
Monica Geller,Why did they get divorced?,train
Rachel Green,"Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn't that sad? God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?",train
Ross Geller,"I know what you mean, I've always wondered how different my life would be if-if I'd never gotten divorced.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Which time?,train
Ross Geller,"The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn't realized she was a lesbian.",train
Joey Tribbiani,I can't. I keep seeing it the good way.,train
Ross Geller,"I'd bet I'd still be doing my kara-tay. Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y'know, not doing anything else physical.",train
Chandler Bing,Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.,train
Monica Geller,"And what if I was still fat? Well, you wouldn't be dating me, that's for sure.",train
Chandler Bing,Sure I would!,train
Chandler Bing,"What, you guys really think that I'm that shallow?",train
Ross Geller,"No, I just think Monica was that fat.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! Oh-hey, there's Carol again!",train
Chandler Bing,"What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I'd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job's fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don't have to wear a tie.",train
Phoebe Buffay,What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?,train
Ross Geller,What?!,train
Rachel Green,Merrill Lynch?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.",train
Rachel Green,Well why didn't you take the job?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y'know that if I'd work with stocks, I'd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.",train
Ross Geller,"Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we'd still hang out?",train
Ross Geller,Oh my God! Rachel Green?,train
Rachel Green,Rob Tillman!,train
Ross Geller,"No-no. It's-it's me, Ross!",train

Joey Tribbiani,"Oh dear God, let me think.",train
Chandler Bing,Hey.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,train

Chandler Bing,"Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not ""Archie Comic funny.""",train
Monica Geller,Okay.,train
Monica Geller,Bye.,train
Chandler Bing,Was his question what's more boring than him?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?",train
Chandler Bing,"Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Really?,train
Chandler Bing,Ehh.,train
Monica Geller,"Maybe Joey doesn't have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"That's an idea! Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?",train
Monica Geller,"No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!",train
Joey Tribbiani,That's great! That would be great! Let's do that!,train
Chandler Bing,I could use the money; it could give me time to write.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Oh right great! Welcome aboard!,train
Chandler Bing,Okay!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don't need any assistance in there, take a break!",train

Rachel Green,"Monica, you should totally put your name down on the list",train
Monica Geller,What?! Are you crazy?! I'm not getting married! I'm not even engaged.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but there's a two-year wait. And then what if you get engaged in two years and then you got to wait another two years for this place. That's four years. Chandler's not gonna wait that long. He's gonna find somebody else, y'know? Someone, someone who did put their name on the list.",train

Phoebe Buffay,"Now, have you told anyone else?",train
Chandler Bing,"No, I don't want to tell anybody else because I don't want Monica to find out.",train

Ross Geller,How rude.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I'm sorry. You wanna bite?",train
Phoebe Buffay,So how are things going with Paul?,train
Rachel Green,"Good. Although y'know, he-he's a private guy. Y'know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.",train
Phoebe Buffay,That's easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won't open.,train
Rachel Green,So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?,train
Phoebe Buffay,No that's what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.,train
Rachel Green,Hi!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Watch this.,train
Rachel Green,Okay.,train
Phoebe Buffay,Hi Paul!,train
Phoebe Buffay,So how are things going with you?,train
Rachel Green,Okay.,train
Ross Geller,Hi!,train
Ross Geller,Great to see you!,train
Ross Geller,How you doing?,train
Ross Geller,Okay! You take care!,train
Ross Geller,"Hey Pheebs, what-what was the deal with you and Chandler blowing us off before?",train

Phoebe Buffay,I didn't do it! It was Chandler! He's... He's mad at you!,train
Ross Geller,What?! Why?!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Please, I think you know why.",train
Ross Geller,I can't think of anything.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on Ross, you're a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.",train
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didn't invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?",train
Phoebe Buffay,Do you think that's something that he'd be mad at you for?,train
Ross Geller,I guess it could.,train
Phoebe Buffay,Well then I think that's it.,train
Ross Geller,"Well, if he's angry, he really shouldn't just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, if that's what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table.",train
Rachel Green,"Yeah that's great. But first, wait, talk to me, talk to me. Tell me about your day.",train
Rachel Green,"Okay. Hey, what are you thinking? What are you thinking right now?",train
Rachel Green,"Yeah that's great Paul, but y'know I wanna know what--Wow, those are really great! I just wanna know what, what is behind this-this strong, silent exterior. Y'know they say that still waters run deep and I wanna swim in yours.",train
Rachel Green,"No Paul, I don't know anything about you! Y'know, like-like your childhood! Tell me about your childhood!",train
Rachel Green,"Okay, well then how about puberty! Come on, that's always a painful time! Y'know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you're sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag.",train
Rachel Green,"Well, you're lucky you never met that bitch Sharon Majesky. Anyway, umm... The rest of you life, y'know? Any regrets?",train
Rachel Green,"All right Paul, I'm not asking for a lot here. Okay? Just give me something. Anything!",train
Rachel Green,Okay.,train
Rachel Green,All right.,train

Rachel Green,Oh!,train
Rachel Green,"Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that y'know, you shared your feelings. It's really, it's beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?",train
Rachel Green,What?! Wait! What are you talking about?! You love their Kung Pao Chicken!,train
Rachel Green,"My God, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I didn't mean to do that! I wouldn't do that!",train
Chandler Bing,Nothin! This is the nine millionth ring store we've been too and I can't find the perfect ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! Ugly ring! It's a beautiful selection.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so maybe you don't get her a ring. Maybe you-maybe you do something different. Y'know? Maybe you get her an engagement bracelet, y'know? Or an engagement tiara? Or-ooh! An engagement Revolutionary War musket! (Picks one up from the display in the corner.",train
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I'm so glad I picked you to help me with this.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Huh? Can you just imagine getting down on one knee and handing her this gorgeous piece of weaponry?,train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'm gonna stick with the ring. Oh, this one's nice! I like this one! Sir? Uh, kind sir? Can I see this one?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait a minute, no, this is, this is the reason you brought me. Okay? I know how to haggle. So let me handle this from here on out.",train
Chandler Bing,"Uh-uh, yes. I would like to see that ring please.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Or not, whatever.",train
Chandler Bing,"Sir, can I ask you to umm, could you...hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?",train
Chandler Bing,"Oh my God that's it, that's the ring! How much is it?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Chandler, I-I will handle this! How much is it?",train
Phoebe Buffay,We will give you $10.,train
Chandler Bing,"Yes! Yes, but I can only pay $8,000.",train

Ross Geller,"Hey, remember how Chandler and Phoebe blew us off yesterday?",train
Joey Tribbiani,No.,train
Ross Geller,Remember? You-you were eating pizza.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.,train
Ross Geller,"Okay. Well, apparently Chandler's angry at us for not getting him a ticket to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, we're supposed to just get him a ticket?! That guy is always mooching off of us!",train
Ross Geller,"Yeah! Anyway, I-I still think we should try to patch things up, y'know? Like uh, maybe we could get him to get tickets to another Knicks game and invite him.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Oh wow that's a great idea! And I still have his credit card.,train
Ross Geller,Oh.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-hey-hey-ho-ho, I got this one. Here you go. Y'know I gotta tell ya, sometimes I just-I don't get Chandler. Y'know, me and him do stuff all the time without you and you don't get all upset.",train
Ross Geller,All the time?,train
Joey Tribbiani,All the time!,train
Rachel Green,Oh my God! Oh my God!!,train
Monica Geller,Still crying?,train
Rachel Green,"Like a little girl. I know. I know. I know. This is all my fault; I wanted him to open up. But God, I didn't know that I was gonna unleash this-this weepy, clingy, moist monster!",train
Monica Geller,"Y'know, I only know of two surefire ways to shut a man up. And one of them is sex.",train
Rachel Green,What's the other one?,train
Monica Geller,"I don't know, I've never had to use the other one. I'm just saying y'know, if we're having sex, he's not gonna be talking.",train
Rachel Green,"Oh that's right. You're the talker. Anyway uh, great idea! Umm, I gotta go to the store; I told him that I would buy him some more tissues.",train
Monica Geller,"Oh, we have some...",train
Rachel Green,No you don't!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay umm, I'd also like to try on the tiara. Oh yeah. Okay. What do you think, too much?",train

Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. It's over!",train
Chandler Bing,What?,train
Phoebe Buffay,Some guy bought it. I'm sorry. I tired to stop it but they put me in jail!,train
Chandler Bing,They put you in jail?,train
Phoebe Buffay,The little jail between the doors!,train
Chandler Bing,"Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, I'm sorry! But y'know, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.",train
Chandler Bing,Yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring I got goose bumps.,train
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe it was the guy.,train
Chandler Bing,It was the ring!,train
Ross Geller,"Hey! So uh, was he excited about the tickets?",train
Joey Tribbiani,No! He blew us off!,train
Ross Geller,What?!,train
Joey Tribbiani,I know!,train
Ross Geller,I can't believe it. Can I tell you something? I'm a little mad at him now.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Can I tell you something? Me too.,train
Ross Geller,"Y'know what? He didn't want to talk to us about being angry, well maybe we don't talk to him at all!",train

Rachel Green,"I don't care about the little dude! I can't! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Y'know, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then it's only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I could've made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!",train
Rachel Green,Oh... I'm sorry. I... I-I don't mean-I didn't mean to stifle you. I... This is all just a little overwhelming.,train

Phoebe Buffay,Hey.,train
Chandler Bing,I can't believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!,train
Phoebe Buffay,It's not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! It's a beautiful ring!,train
Chandler Bing,"No, it's not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monica's face when I gave it to her, y'know? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. Look, this is the most important thing I'm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure it's perfect.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. 'Cause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.,train
Chandler Bing,I can't do that.,train
Phoebe Buffay,Well you certainly can't give her that stupid gumball ring.,train
Phoebe Buffay,There he is!,train
Chandler Bing,Okay and he hasn't proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! You're good! After this, we should solve crimes.",train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, okay. Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.",train
Phoebe Buffay,It is your office.,train
Phoebe Buffay,John?,train
Phoebe Buffay,Here he is.,train
Chandler Bing,"Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring you're about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, I'm gonna need to have that back. But, in exchange I'm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. Ew.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! I would trade.,train
Chandler Bing,No-no! This is my fiancee and her heart was set on that ring. You don't want to break her heart now do you?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, do you want to break a dying woman's heart?",train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, she's dying... Of a cough apparently.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if I'm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity...",train
Chandler Bing,"Okay, that's enough honey!",train

Rachel Green,"Phoebe, don't you think you've had enough to drink?",train
Phoebe Buffay,I'm just helping the kids!,train
Rachel Green,How is you drinking helping the kids?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Because the more I drink, the less there is for the kids to drink.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Oh hi!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Just out of curiosity, how-how much is that boat worth?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I was pretty close. Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I can't buy the boat, I don't have any money.",train
Rachel Green,"Joey! Joey, good one!",train

Monica Geller,Why don't you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean that's what I did when I first weighing stuff.,train

Joey Tribbiani,Glove salesman!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Good one! Yeah.,train
Chandler Bing,This is terrible. What am I going to do?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesn't know for sure, so just throw her off the track.",train

Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that you're scared of commitment! Convince her that you're a little coward!,train
Chandler Bing,"I can do that, I've had 30 years of practice.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!",train
Monica Geller,I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!,train
Joey Tribbiani,That guy's still doing that?!,train
Rachel Green,"Hey! Oh my God you're here, let me see your hand!!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"No, you're too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!",train

Ross Geller,What?!,train
Ross Geller,"Okay, break-up's still on!",train
Chandler Bing,"Okay, okay, here she comes! How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesn't want to get married?",train

Monica Geller,Hi guys!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,train
Chandler Bing,Hey!,train
Monica Geller,What are you up too?,train
Chandler Bing,"Oh, just hanging out, talkin' about uh, websites. Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, Big Brother.",train
Monica Geller,Well that's a little crazy. Although I am y'know glad to hear that you're branching out on what you look at on the Internet.,train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well... Y'know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?",train
Monica Geller,Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!,train
Chandler Bing,Eh...,train
Monica Geller,Okay well that's good to know.,train
Joey Tribbiani,The Mr. Bowmont's here!!!,train
Monica Geller,"Sure, I love this part!",train

Monica Geller,"Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?",train
Monica Geller,What uh-What did you-What?!,train

Monica Geller,Yeah!,train
Monica Geller,Why? Because of the government.,train
Rachel Green,"Isn't it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettin' married.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, they're gonna be so happy together.",train
Rachel Green,"Ohh... I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?",train
Phoebe Buffay,Not that often!,train
Rachel Green,No! I'm so happy for them!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Me too! So happy for them!,train
Rachel Green,I'm so happy and not at all jealous.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!",train
Rachel Green,"I mean I'm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean what's 2%? That's nothing.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Totally. I'm like 90/10.,train
Rachel Green,Yeah me too.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?",train
Rachel Green,"Wh-no, but y'know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.",train
Monica Geller,"So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you don't really believe that do you?",train
Chandler Bing,"Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Let's take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs don't mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that's just an ordinary pig not even a pig that's good at sports!",train
Monica Geller,"Yeah, but that's pigs not people!",train
Chandler Bing,"If marriage worked, I'd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.",train
Monica Geller,Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?,train
Chandler Bing,"Well, never say never but y'know probably uh yeah, never.",train
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!,train
Chandler Bing,Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why don't you put down your copy of 'The Rules' huh mantrap?!,train
Monica Geller,Y'know what?! I gotta go! Ugh!,train
Chandler Bing,"It's okay, I got a plan.",train
Rachel Green,We're gonna find love!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Definitely!,train
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I'm pretty confident about that. That's what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.",train
Phoebe Buffay,What do you mean?,train
Rachel Green,"Well y'know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they're 40, they marry each other.",train
Phoebe Buffay,You mean a backup?,train
Rachel Green,Exactly!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, yeah I got that.",train
Rachel Green,You do?,train
Phoebe Buffay,Hm-mmm.,train
Rachel Green,Who?,train
Phoebe Buffay,Joey.,train
Rachel Green,Joey?!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah!,train
Rachel Green,Are you serious?!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I locked him years ago!",train
Rachel Green,"Wh... So... If neither of you are married by the time you're 40, you're gonna marry Joey.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, seriously?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words were...",train
Rachel Green,Charming.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Well hey, it's just a backup.",train
Rachel Green,Yeah.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Monica!,train
Monica Geller,Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?",train
Monica Geller,"Yeah, it's great.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa-whoa, what's the matter?! Talk to the captain!",train
Monica Geller,I'm just having one of those days where you realize you're in a dead-end relationship!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler giving you a hard time huh?,train
Monica Geller,"It's not like I want to get married tomorrow! It's just that I-I'd like to believe that I'm in a relationship that's actually going somewhere, that I'm not just wasting my time!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you know Chandler.",train
Monica Geller,No I don't know Chandler! Not anymore! It's like it's like something's changed.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe you changed?,train
Monica Geller,I didn't change!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe that's the problem.,train
Monica Geller,What?!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.",train
Monica Geller,Is that some kind of boat talk?,train
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know! I haven't totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.,train
Monica Geller,What does he think? Does he think I'm just gonna wait around for nothing?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!",train
Monica Geller,Well there's some people who do want to marry me.,train
Joey Tribbiani,There are?,train
Monica Geller,Yeah! Richard!,train
Joey Tribbiani,R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! And-and Chandler's tellin' ya how much he hates marriage?!,train
Monica Geller,That's right.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler loves marriage!!,train
Monica Geller,You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that he's a-a complex fellow who's unlikely to take a wife! That-that he's against marriage and always will be!,train
Joey Tribbiani,You got that from what I said?!,train
Ross Geller,What happened you guys?,train
Ross Geller,Rach!,train
Rachel Green,Hey you!,train
Ross Geller,"Hey, come on in.",train
Rachel Green,"Oh thank you. Hey y'know, I'm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.",train
Ross Geller,"Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought we'd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn't meant to be.",train
Rachel Green,"Yeah, love. It's a tricky business isn't it?",train
Ross Geller,I guess so.,train
Rachel Green,"So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time we're 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we've-we've already slept together so y'know there'll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, ""What's that?!""",train
Ross Geller,Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.,train
Rachel Green,Exactly.,train
Ross Geller,"Ohh, yeah I already have one.",train
Rachel Green,What? Who?,train
Ross Geller,Phoebe.,train
Rachel Green,"Phoebe?! Wait a-but-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.",train
Ross Geller,"Ohh, I don't think so.",train
Rachel Green,"Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!",train
Ross Geller,"That's impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Where the hell have you been?!,train
Chandler Bing,I was making a coconut phone with the professor.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!,train
Chandler Bing,What?!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Yeah, I've been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these damn boat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!",train
Chandler Bing,My-Oh my God!,train
Joey Tribbiani,I know! They suck!!,train
Chandler Bing,He's not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! I'm supposed to do that!,train
Joey Tribbiani,I know!,train
Chandler Bing,Well what... Y'know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go over there; I'm gonna kick his ass! Will you help me?!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, Chandler I don't think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!",train
Chandler Bing,You're right.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!,train
Chandler Bing,Okay. I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna get the ring! I'm gonna go find her and I'm just going to propose!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.,train
Chandler Bing,Okay great.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Dude-dude-dude!,train
Chandler Bing,What?!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.",train
Monica Geller,Hi.,train
Monica Geller,I don't know why I'm here.,train
Monica Geller,I don't know.,train
Monica Geller,Chandler is such an idiot!,train
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I'll have a scotch...",train
Monica Geller,Still smoking cigars?,train
Monica Geller,"No that's, that's okay.",train
Monica Geller,"Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.",train
Monica Geller,Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don't like my new eye doctor.,train
Monica Geller,Edward Nevski?,train
Monica Geller,No.,train
Monica Geller,But getting over was the hardest thing that I've ever had to do. And I never let myself think about you.,train
Rachel Green,Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Of course I can! It's just good sense to backup your backup! Look, I've already lost Chandler!",train
Rachel Green,What?!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,train
Ross Geller,Hey!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Phoebe! We're both your backup?!,train
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, how could you do this to me?!",train
Phoebe Buffay,I don't-Look I don't know what you're complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!,train
Joey Tribbiani,No we weren't!,train
Ross Geller,I was not!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we're married!",train
Rachel Green,Phoebe you can't have both of them! You have to pick one!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Pick me!!,train
Ross Geller,No! Pick me! I don't want to end up an old maid!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"All right well let's see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat-This is hard!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!",train
Ross Geller,"Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!",train

Joey Tribbiani,"Hey little buddy, how are you feeling? What the hell is in that face cream? That's so soft. Pillowcases! Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicar... The vicar? ...wouldn't be home for hours. Her loins were burning. She threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his... Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho-ho! This is a dirty book!",train

Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.",train
Ross Geller,Phoebe!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, let's talk outside.",train

Phoebe Buffay,What's the big deal? I did it at Monica and Chandler's!,train
Ross Geller,And they knew about it?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?",train
Ross Geller,"Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!",train

Ross Geller,"The big deal is I don't want naked, greasy strangers in my apartment when I want to kick back with a puzzle-beer! Cold beer.",train
Rachel Green,"Hey Joey, what 'cha doing?",train
Joey Tribbiani,Sweepin'. Why? Turn you on?,train
Rachel Green,No.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Huh. What if I was sweeping a chimney?,train

Rachel Green,"Hey-hey, y'know what? I don't care! I'm not ashamed of my book. There's nothing with a woman enjoying a little...erotica. It's just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand.",train
Joey Tribbiani,You got porn!,train
Ross Geller,Hello.,train
Ross Geller,"Uh no-no, she-she's out for the night.",train
Ross Geller,"Can I, can I help you with something?",train

Monica Geller,I can't believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!,train
Ross Geller,"Okay! Now, I'm going to touch you. Ohh, that's soft.",train
Monica Geller,I can't believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?,train
Chandler Bing,"I don't know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. She's saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to Dollywood.",train
Rachel Green,Well what happened at dinner?,train
Monica Geller,My parents spent the money for our wedding!,train

Rachel Green,"Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.",train
Chandler Bing,"Well, you're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?",train
Chandler Bing,"Well, come on, I've been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! Hello, Mr. Chandler.",train
Monica Geller,This is the most special day of our lives.,train
Chandler Bing,"No, I realize that honey, but I'm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.",train
Monica Geller,"Honey, umm I-I love you, but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, we're only gonna get married once.",train
Chandler Bing,"Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.",train

Rachel Green,Nothing!,train
Ross Geller,"Damn, this coffee's cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins?",train

Ross Geller,"Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! 'Sup?",train
Phoebe Buffay,Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!,train
Ross Geller,Excuse me ladies. I'm sorry?,train

Ross Geller,I gave him an extremely professional massage!,train
Phoebe Buffay,He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.,train

Phoebe Buffay,"Well, he's never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!",train
Ross Geller,"Hey, y'know what? This is your fault! You're the one that didn't move his-his appointment.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's my fault?! You didn't have to massage him! You could've sent him away! You could've not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!",train
Ross Geller,"He said he liked that!! Oh you're right, you're right. I'm sorry.",train

Monica Geller,"Eh, you work for that.",train
Chandler Bing,"Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.",train
Monica Geller,You do?!,train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then that's what we're gonna do.",train
Monica Geller,"Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?",train
Chandler Bing,"Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.",train
Monica Geller,You thought about that?,train
Chandler Bing,Yeah.,train
Monica Geller,How many kids were we gonna have?,train
Chandler Bing,"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.",train
Monica Geller,What else did you think about?,train
Chandler Bing,"Well, stuff like where'd we live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on it's collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.",train

Joey Tribbiani,Yes.,train
Rachel Green,"Don't just say yes! This isn't a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!",train

Ross Geller,And what did he ask you not to call him?,train

Ross Geller,"Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?",train
Monica Geller,"Listen, I'm sure that dad doesn't care. He probably thought this was funny; he'll be telling this story for years!",train
Chandler Bing,I don't want him to tell this story for years.,train
Ross Geller,"Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.",train
Monica Geller,I wasn't escaping.,train
Ross Geller,Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?,train
Monica Geller,I was trying to help out a squirrel.,train
Ross Geller,You were trying to eat it!,train

Ross Geller,"Whoa-whoa, aren't you a little over dressed?",train
Rachel Green,"Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.",train

Ross Geller,You have to respect the sea!,train
Rachel Green,"Look Joey, I'm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Does a good teacher say, ""Put down the beer pinhead!?""",train
Rachel Green,"Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?",train
Joey Tribbiani,Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?,train
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I didn't want you to get hit by the boom!",train

Rachel Green,"Joey, come on! We just went over this!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, y'know, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!",train
Rachel Green,"No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!",train
Joey Tribbiani,All right that's it! You're yelling and I don't see you taking your top off! I quit!,train
Rachel Green,What do you mean you quit?! You can't quit!,train

Ross Geller,Looking up?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah-No, she was really nice to me, but she's in hell for sure.",train

Monica Geller,In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! That's not the point.,train
Chandler Bing,"Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!",train
Monica Geller,"Well... That's not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.",train
Chandler Bing,"Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.",train
Monica Geller,How?,train
Chandler Bing,You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!,train
Monica Geller,"What if I have babies, okay? I mean I'm gonna look different. I'm okay with that, but I'm not sure that you are!",train
Chandler Bing,"Look you have to realize I don't think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is you're Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.",train
Monica Geller,Keep going.,train
Chandler Bing,So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.,train

Phoebe Buffay,"Y'know Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monica's made of honor.",train
Rachel Green,You do? Why?,train
Phoebe Buffay,Because I think it means more to you.,train
Rachel Green,"But Pheebs, y'know you earned it.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Its fine. I mean, this is something that you've been thinking about since you were what, 14?",train
Rachel Green,"No, I was ten. I just developed early.",train

Rachel Green,"Y'know what? That's a lot to remember, can't I just tell her you're a pig?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I'm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! He'd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, he'd make extras and leave 'em for me.",train

Phoebe Buffay,Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?,train

Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?,train
Rachel Green,Do you want some pancakes?,train
Joey Tribbiani,Finally!,train
Monica Geller,What are we gonna do?,train
Chandler Bing,I say we go with Careless Whisper.,train
Chandler Bing,Did she see us yet? Did she see us?,train
Monica Geller,"Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?",train
Monica Geller,Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice aren't they?,train
Chandler Bing,Aren't you just a tinsy bit curious?,train
Monica Geller,"Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.",train
Monica Geller,We'll just...we'll just let her stay.,train
Chandler Bing,"No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!",train
Monica Geller,Kinda like your Barca lounger.,train
Chandler Bing,Is that what you're thinking about right now?,train
Monica Geller,I never stop thinking about it.,train
Chandler Bing,"Janice, I'm sorry but umm, you can't stay here tonight.",train
Chandler Bing,"Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.",train
Monica Geller,Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!,train
Monica Geller,Because Chandler still has feelings for you!,train
Chandler Bing,Say again?,train
Monica Geller,That's right. That's right. And that is why you can't stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldn't come to the wedding.,train
Chandler Bing,"Feelings, such strong feelings.",train
Monica Geller,"I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.",train
Ross Geller,"Don't sweat it, I've got this section covered. Yeah, in fact I've got this little baby to shine in people's eye--Okay, see you later.",train

Ross Geller,Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!,train
Chandler Bing,"No, no, no. No-no-no.",train
Ross Geller,"What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?",train
Chandler Bing,"No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.",train
Ross Geller,What? That's like insanely easy!,train
Chandler Bing,"Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen .",train
Monica Geller,"It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.",train
Ross Geller,What? You forgot fourteen states?,train
Monica Geller,Nobody cares about the Dakotas.,train
Chandler Bing,"Oh, okay, time's up!",train
Rachel Green,"All right, I got 48.",train
Chandler Bing,"Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I Got Tired Of Naming States. So I Decided To List The Types Of Celery, And I Have One regular celery.",train

Joey Tribbiani,Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.,train
Ross Geller,"Wow, how many have you got?",train
Joey Tribbiani,Fifty-six!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!,train
Chandler Bing,Does South Oregon have a sports-team? There you go.,train
Rachel Green,How come we have one extra place setting?,train
Monica Geller,'Cause you invited your assistant.,train
Rachel Green,"Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.",train
Monica Geller,Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.,train
Rachel Green,"Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.",train
Monica Geller,"Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, but I still do.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Regular Celery! Oh, I already have that.",train
Ross Geller,Done! With time a-to-spare.,train
Chandler Bing,Oooh that may be a New World's record,train
Ross Geller,"You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called ""a globe?"" Hmm?",train
Chandler Bing,"Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states.",train
Ross Geller,What? That's impossible.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?",train
Monica Geller,"All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!",train
Chandler Bing,"I am only one man! Okay Ross, time is up!",train
Ross Geller,"No, just give me another minute.",train
Chandler Bing,"Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.",train
Ross Geller,"This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.",train
Chandler Bing,"Okay, but if you can't...no dinner!",train
Ross Geller,You're on!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.",train
Monica Geller,"Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?",train
Monica Geller,"Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?",train
Ross Geller,Pshhshhh!,train
Monica Geller,Chandler? Can you give me a hand?,train
Chandler Bing,"Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.,train
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, why is your bag moving?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's not!",train
Rachel Green,"Seriously, it's moving!",train
Joey Tribbiani,What the hell is in there?,train
Phoebe Buffay,It's just my knitting that's all! Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.,train
Monica Geller,Ross's apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?,train
Chandler Bing,I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.,train
Monica Geller,That's my pie!,train
Chandler Bing,Which smells delicious!,train
Monica Geller,Uh-oh! Uh-oh!,train
Chandler Bing,What?,train
Monica Geller,"We left Joey alone with the food! Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!",train
Phoebe Buffay,Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?,train
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, who's this?",train
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!",train
Chandler Bing,"Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"No, there's no dog here?",train
Monica Geller,Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.,train
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my god! Where are you?,train
Monica Geller,I'll be right there!,train
Phoebe Buffay,They're here already? How are they doing this?,train
Rachel Green,Hi Tag! What are you doing here?,train
Rachel Green,"Well, sure! Come in! Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, I'm sorry.",train
Ross Geller,Ohio!! Thank you!,train
Chandler Bing,Huh! Where is the dog?!,train
Ross Geller,What dog? There-there's no dog here.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah that dog left!,train
Monica Geller,"Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!",train
Phoebe Buffay,There's no dog in here.,train
Chandler Bing,"Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"No that's just me coughing! Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.",train
Chandler Bing,What is it doing here?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?",train
Monica Geller,"Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!",train
Chandler Bing,"Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days",train
Chandler Bing,Really?,train
Monica Geller,"Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?",train
Chandler Bing,"Well, it still has to go, right?",train
Chandler Bing,"Okay, it's um...",train
Joey Tribbiani,Don't do it!,train
Monica Geller,Don't do what?,train
Chandler Bing,"I have to! Okay? It's time! Okay, I hate dogs.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Are you crazy?,train
Ross Geller,Are you out of your mind?,train
Phoebe Buffay,Why?,train
Joey Tribbiani,Told ya.,train
Chandler Bing,"They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.",train
Ross Geller,"Right, they are scary. Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!",train
Rachel Green,"Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?",train
Chandler Bing,Is there a puppy here?,train
Chandler Bing,"Okay, you are new!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likin' ice cream.",train
Phoebe Buffay,You don't like ice cream?,train
Ross Geller,It's too cold.,train
Chandler Bing,"Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.",train
Ross Geller,It hurts my teeth.,train
Chandler Bing,"And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. Oh my god!!",train
Ross Geller,How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.,train
Monica Geller,1250.,train
Ross Geller,"Damn, I forgot you were here.",train
Phoebe Buffay,All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Ross's. We'll be back in a minute.,train
Rachel Green,"Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?",train
Monica Geller,Yeah.,train
Rachel Green,"When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'd say about a month.",train
Monica Geller,Really? I'd say 3 to 4.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Half hour.,train
Rachel Green,Interesting.,train
Monica Geller,"When it's your assistant, I would say never.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.",train
Rachel Green,Huh. A moo-point?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.",train
Rachel Green,"Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?",train
Monica Geller,"Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-he's obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers. What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.",train
Rachel Green,"You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.",train
Rachel Green,Hey!,train
Rachel Green,How are you holding up?,train
Rachel Green,Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.,train
Rachel Green,So were you guys together a long time?,train
Rachel Green,Now that she broke up with you?,train
Rachel Green,Yeah. Hmmmm.,train
Rachel Green,"No...Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure it...it has to work out.",train
Rachel Green,"Because, uh-it has to.",train
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.",train
Rachel Green,"Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Street noise drowned any of that out? No, all right, I see you later, okay...",train
Rachel Green,"Uh, yeah, well, see, he... Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, and...you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!",train
Rachel Green,"No? All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.",train
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.",train
Rachel Green,What?,train
Rachel Green,"Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?",train
Rachel Green,"Wait, we still have time to talk and they're-they're not even in the car yet! Oh look, there they go, okay.",train
Monica Geller,"Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.",train
Monica Geller,Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, okay.",train
Monica Geller,"Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! Oooh, I can't leave her!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.",train
Monica Geller,That's not gonna work.,train
Phoebe Buffay,I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.,train
Monica Geller,Hey! I didn't know either.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?",train
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I knew.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Where's Chandler?,train
Chandler Bing,Here I am.,train
Phoebe Buffay,Wash your hands!!!,train
Chandler Bing,How did you...know?,train
Ross Geller,Hey! What's she doing back here?,train
Monica Geller,"Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!",train
Ross Geller,"Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...",train
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.",train
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but, but look what I'm...",train
Phoebe Buffay,"See, this is exactly what we do not have time for.",train
Chandler Bing,Where's Monica?,train
Ross Geller,"Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.",train
Chandler Bing,Why not?,train
Ross Geller,Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.,train
Chandler Bing,"Well, I, I should go in there.",train
Ross Geller,"No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.",train
Chandler Bing,Why not?,train
Ross Geller,Because you sent away the dog!,train
Chandler Bing,This is ridiculous.,train
Ross Geller,"Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friend...Phyllis...take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! What's the matter?",train
Chandler Bing,"Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.",train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.",train
Chandler Bing,And that doesn't scare you?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Ross, you need some help?",train
Ross Geller,"From you? Yes, please!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!",train
Ross Geller,"I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.,train
Rachel Green,"Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out",train
Joey Tribbiani,"If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, is Chandler here?",train
Chandler Bing,"No, no he went for a walk.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!",train
Rachel Green,Hi!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!",train
Joey Tribbiani,You think?,train
Monica Geller,"Hi, honey.",train
Chandler Bing,"Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.",train
Monica Geller,"What? Why, why would...",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.",train
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Y'know, for you, and... I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"We have good news, look whose back!",train
Rachel Green,Hi!,train
Chandler Bing,Clunkers?! Oh my god!,train
Monica Geller,"That's right, she came back all by herself.",train
Phoebe Buffay,It's a Thanksgiving miracle!,train
Chandler Bing,It is so good to see you!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in... I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?",train
Ross Geller,"Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.",train
Chandler Bing,It's up to you.,train
Rachel Green,"Oh, hi! How are you doing?",train
Rachel Green,Oh.,train
Ross Geller,"Tag? Y-You're going? Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?",train
Ross Geller,"Ah, what good are you.",train
Rachel Green,"Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.",train
Rachel Green,"Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It-y'know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.",train
Rachel Green,Really?,train
Rachel Green,"Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.",train
Ross Geller,Delaware! Delaware!,train

Chandler Bing,That sounds like my first bike. My dad gave me his old one.,train
Ross Geller,Ohh.,train
Monica Geller,Did the girl ever let you ride it?,train
Phoebe Buffay,No! But she gave me the box that it came in. It had a picture of the bike on the front. So I would sit on it and my step-dad would drag me around the backyard.,train

Rachel Green,I'm thinkin' no.,train
Rachel Green,"Umm, I said I thought you were a good kisser, and uh, and that I like your tiney-tiny touchie.",train
Rachel Green,"Well, it gets worse. When asked if you take initiative I wrote, ""Yes, he was able to unhook my bra with minimal supervision,"" and under Problems with Performance I wrote, ""Dear God, I hope not,"" and then uh, then I drew a little smiley face, and then a small pornographic sketch.",train
Monica Geller,"Ross! That is so sweet of you to get Phoebe that bike! When I heard the story, I almost cried.",train

Chandler Bing,What happened? I'm just eating candy.,train
Rachel Green,"Maybe it's not as bad as I think. Y'know, maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.",train
Chandler Bing,"Absolutely! Y'know, because touchie can mean both ass and good worker.",train
Rachel Green,"Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back!",train
Joey Tribbiani,Hey Rach?,train

Ross Geller,"Phoebe, you can't get out of this! Okay? You have to learn how to ride a bike!",train
Phoebe Buffay,Why? Why do I have to learn?,train
Ross Geller,Well...In-in case of emergency.,train
Phoebe Buffay,What kind of an emergency?,train
Ross Geller,"Well let there-what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says, ""You ride this bike or I'll sh...I'll shoot you.""",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I would ring the bell to distract him and then I would knock the gun out of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.",train
Ross Geller,"Okay, Phoebe just-just get-get on the bike and-Hey! I'll hold you up and-and push you. Okay?",train
Phoebe Buffay,You won't let go?,train

Phoebe Buffay,I could've been killed I hope you know!,train
Ross Geller,"I know. I know. But, can we please try it again? Huh? I mean, you were so close Phoebe!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I would love to but...the bike got stolen and the police have no suspects.",train
Ross Geller,Phoebe.,train
Phoebe Buffay,What?! What the hell?!,train
Ross Geller,"All right, y'know what? If you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then I'm sorry, I'm just gonna have to take it back.",train
Phoebe Buffay,What?! Why?!,train
Ross Geller,"Because! Because, it-it-it's... It'd be like you having this guitar and-and never playing it. Okay, this guitar wants to be played! And-and this bike wants to be ridden and-and if you don't ride it you-you're-you're killing its spirit! The bike is dying.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"All right. If you care enough to make up that load of crap, okay.",train
Ross Geller,Great! Great! You're making the bike very happy.,train
Phoebe Buffay,Okay Ross! Please don't die!,train
Rachel Green,"Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back before they see it, but we're gonna have to get into Mr. Zelner's office. Now, he doesn't get in until 10, so he's no problem, but his assistant, Betty, she comes in early to eat her breakfast at her desk.",train
Rachel Green,"Yeah, well Betty's kinda sad. Which is why I believe I can lure her away with these chocolates. Now, while I distract her, you get in the office.",train
Rachel Green,Let's roll!,train
Rachel Green,"Yeah, sure Mr. Zelner, for you anything-minute. Okay. Fine. Abort the plan, abort the plan.",train
Rachel Green,"Okay. Uh, well can we, can we get you anything Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?",train

Chandler Bing,"All right everybody! Just be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!! Pipe-pipe-pipe down! What is the matter with you people?! This woman was trying to do a nice thing for you. She was making candy so she could try to get to know all of you, and I'll bet that not one of you can tell me her name! Am I right?",train
Chandler Bing,No not Candy Lady.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, if we know it can we have candy?!!",train

Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, sorry about that. Mob mentality or whatever, I don't know...",train
Phoebe Buffay,I can't believe it! I did it! I rode a bike! I never thought I'd be able to do that! Thank you Ross.,train

Ross Geller,Hey!,train
Monica Geller,Licorice?,train
Ross Geller,"Sure! Hey, I just found out, I get Ben for the holidays this year.",train

Chandler Bing,"No reason, except...she...told...me.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Really? So she said, she didn't wanna live with me anymore?",train
Chandler Bing,"No! No, she didn't say that. I-I-I think you should talk to Monica now.",train

Phoebe Buffay,You're sure? You're absolutely sure?,train
Monica Geller,"Well, no. But, um, I bet she probably does.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Probably? Yeah, I don't like that word. Kind of what 'probably' really means. Yeah, uh-huh. Yeah, oh, ""Your mom probably won't kill herself,"" y'know?

Joey Tribbiani,Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.,train
Chandler Bing,Hey Pheebs!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,train
Chandler Bing,"If you wanna give Joey a Christmas present that disrupts the entire building, why not get him something a little bit more subtle, like a wrecking ball, or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway?",train
Monica Geller,"It's not just the drum noise. Every five minutes, Joey throws his sticks in the air, and I have to hear, ""Oh my eye! Oh god, my eye!"" I mean, it is so annoying.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, thank you. You see, this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums.",train
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, you got Joey drums to annoy Rachel, so she wouldn't wanna live there anymore?",train
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe on some level.,train
Rachel Green,"Joey, y'know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air.",train
Joey Tribbiani,What is Rock 'n' Roll about that?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, Joey, I got you another present.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh wait, before you tell me what it is! Okay, what is it?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"It's a...tarantula! Oh! God! Rachel, look, I'm sorry. What was I thinking giving Joey this big, gross, scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage?",train
Rachel Green,"What are you talking about? I love them! Yeah, I had a tarantula when I was a kid. But it-it died, because my cat ate it. And then, then my cat died. But Joey, isn't this cool?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Is it on me? I feel, I feel like it's on me! I got, hey!",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, isn't that adorable? Joey is afraid of the tarantula.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Ah, yeah, he's so adorable, God, he's just so much fun, Joey is the best, I'm glad you're having so much fun here.",train
Rachel Green,"What? Wait-wait a minute, what? Phoebe, what's the matter?",train
Phoebe Buffay,Our apartment is ready.,train
Rachel Green,And that makes you angry because...,train
Phoebe Buffay,Because you would rather live here with Joey.,train
Rachel Green,Where did you get that?,train
Phoebe Buffay,Monica and Chandler said that you were having so much fun here. And apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is gonna change that.,train
Rachel Green,Phoebe?,train
Phoebe Buffay,Hm?,train
Rachel Green,"Did you get all this stuff for Joey to try and drive me out of the apartment? Honey, if you wanted to do that, you might as well just gotten him a fish, you know how fish freaked me out!",train

Ross Geller,Hey!,train
Ross Geller,"No, these are my pants.",train
Ross Geller,"Well, uh, do you have a Santa-outfit left?",train

Ross Geller,I'm the holiday armadillo! I'm a friend of Santa's and he sent me here to wish you a Merry Christmas!,train
Monica Geller,"What happened to Santa, Holiday Armadillo?",train
Ross Geller,Santa was unavailable so close to Christmas.,train
Monica Geller,"Wow, come in, have a seat. You must be exhausted coming all the way from...Texas.",train
Ross Geller,"That's right, Ben. I'm Santa's representative for all the southern states. And Mexico! But, Santa sent me here to give you these presents, Ben. Maybe the Lady will help me with these presents.",train
Ross Geller,"You're welcome, Ben. Merry Christmas, ooh, and Happy Hanukkah!",train
Ross Geller,"You are? Me, too!",train
Monica Geller,Because Armadillos also wandered in the desert?,train
Ross Geller,"You wanna wander in the hall? Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the festival of lights?",train

Chandler Bing,"You bet I did, Ben, put it there! Well, it would have worked this time, if his hands weren't so damn small! Ho, ho, ho!",train
Monica Geller,"Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo, and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence, I never thought I'd say.",train
Ross Geller,What are you doing?,train
Chandler Bing,"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!",train
Ross Geller,"Thank you, but, but you gotta leave.",train
Chandler Bing,Why?,train
Ross Geller,"Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.",train
Chandler Bing,But I didn't get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly.,train
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry, Chandler but this, this is really important to me.",train
Chandler Bing,"Fine, I'll give the suit back.",train
Monica Geller,"Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?",train
Chandler Bing,Santa? Really?,train
Monica Geller,"Yes, is that okay?",train
Chandler Bing,Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?,train
Monica Geller,No.,train
Chandler Bing,Then it's okay!,train
Ross Geller,"Okay Ben, Santa has to go. Say good-bye!",train
Chandler Bing,"Because, if Santa and the Holiday...Armadillo? ...are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode. Merry Christmas!",train
Ross Geller,"Fine, I-I give up. Santa, Santa can stay.",train
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'll stay, but only because I wanna hear about Hanukkah. Ben, will you sit here with Santa and learn about Hanukkah?",train
Ross Geller,"All right, it's time for the story of Hanukkah. Years and years ago, there were these people called the Maccabees.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Merry Christmas!,train
Rachel Green,Oh wow! Look at this place!,train

Chandler Bing,I-no! I didn't read the box before I opened it. And you can't return a box after you've opened the box.,train
Rachel Green,"Why, why not?",train
Chandler Bing,Because it's too delicious.,train
Rachel Green,"Chandler, you stole this cheesecake. That is wrong.",train
Chandler Bing,"No-no-no! It is going to be okay, because Mrs. Braverman is gonna send away for a free one and that way we all win! The only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate, Momma's Little Bakery. I feel terrible, I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.",train

Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex!",train
Ross Geller,"Phoebe he's right, that is the rule.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't accept this rule. When me make plans, I expect you to show up. Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time 'til you meet someone better! Y'know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go, but this is for life!",train
Joey Tribbiani,Wow! I'm so sorry; I had no idea it would bother you this much.,train

Chandler Bing,Well I've forgotten what it tastes like okay?!,train

Chandler Bing,Y'know what? Forget it! We are just hungry! We have not had lunch! We are just light-headed! So let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake.,train
Rachel Green,Yeah and we'll drop it off downstairs so that we're not tempted.,train
Chandler Bing,Good idea. Where do you want to go to lunch?,train

Monica Geller,Limited seating?! I am just one tiny person!,train
Ross Geller,"Well yeah, but she doesn't know that. I mean, the last time she saw you-you would've turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling.",train
Monica Geller,"Limited seating! Oh, that is such a lame excuse! That's not the reason she's not inviting me!",train
Ross Geller,"Oh what's the big deal?! I wasn't even invited to the ceremony, just the reception. And-and y'know what? If it makes you feel any better, Joan and I will just make an appearance and then, and then we'll-we'll leave early as a sign of protest.",train

Ross Geller,Not broad backed!,train
Monica Geller,"Wait a minute, y'know, you're bringing me!",train
Ross Geller,What? I can't cancel on Joan!,train
Monica Geller,Why not?!,train
Ross Geller,"Bec-Did you not hear me?! She's an assistant professor in the Linguistics department, okay? They're wild! Why do you want to come anyway?",train
Monica Geller,"Because! She's my cousin. I mean, we grew up together! We're family y'know? Well that's important to me.",train
Ross Geller,"Okay, all right, I'll take you. I'll go call Joan.",train

Rachel Green,Its still there!,train
Chandler Bing,Mrs. Braverman must be out.,train
Rachel Green,She could be out of town. Maybe she'll be gone for months.,train
Chandler Bing,"By then, the cheesecake may have gone bad. We don't want her to come back to bad cheesecake.",train
Rachel Green,No that could kill her.,train
Chandler Bing,"Well, we don't want that.",train
Rachel Green,No so we're protecting her.,train
Chandler Bing,But we should take it.,train

Chandler Bing,No-no-no-no! That was the joke!,train
Rachel Green,"No, I know! I get it! It's funny!",train
Chandler Bing,"No, because you're not a grandmother!",train

Monica Geller,All you had to do was buy the card!,train
Ross Geller,Hey! Look who's back! It's the birthday girl! How's the birthday girl feeling?,train
Rachel Green,"Well, I feel fine, but I think you're bumming out the rest of the kids.",train

Rachel Green,Okay! Y'know what? I realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids. All I really needed was a plan. See I wanna have three kids...,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh let me guess, and you wanna have them all at the same time and you wanna have them for your brother.",train
Rachel Green,As I was saying... I should probably have the first of the three kids by the time I'm 35 which gives me five years. I love this plan! I wanna marry this plan!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"If you could do that, I'd marry the hippity-hop.",train
Rachel Green,"So, if I wanna have my kid when I'm 35, I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34. Which gives Prada four years to start making maternity clothes! Oh wait, but I do want to be married for a year before I get pregnant...",train
Monica Geller,"Really! That long?! Look all you want, it's happening!",train
Rachel Green,"No, so I don't have to get married until I'm 33! That's three years, that's three whole years-Oh, wait a minute though. I'll need a year and a half to plan the wedding, and I'd like to know the guy for a year, year and a half before we get engaged... Which means I need to meet the guy by the time I'm thirty.",train
Ross Geller,Which is fine! Because you just turned--twenty-eight!,train
Rachel Green,"No! Ross, no! It is not fine! Eh-eh-according to my plan I should already be with the guy I wanna marry!",train
Joey Tribbiani,Will you quit hoggin' it!,train
Rachel Green,I'm telling you it's like watching Bambi learn how to walk.,train

Joey Tribbiani,Like what?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Like okay I-I-I, I haven't met any Portuguese people! I, I haven't had the perfect kiss! And I haven't been to sniper's school!",train
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, y'know why don't we just go upstairs and have some birthday cake?",train

Phoebe Buffay,"Rach, so, that guy there. Straight or gay?",train
Rachel Green,"Well, I'd have to say gay.",train

Phoebe Buffay,Oh no not that guy there. That guy right there.,train
Rachel Green,Oh yeah he's too cute to be straight.,train
Phoebe Buffay,Ohh knockers will help us figure it out.,train
Rachel Green,"All right, straight, and not subtle.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, he left his cell phone.",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, well, we can hand it to Gunther and he'll put it in lost and found.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Or we could use it to call China. See how those guys are doing.,train
Rachel Green,"What if, um, if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and I answer and we start talking and we fell in love. I mean wouldn't that be a great story? Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah... That does sound great. I'm going to get the phone.,train
Rachel Green,What? Wait! Why...why do you get the story?,train
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know. I haven't been out on a date in so long.,train

Rachel Green,"Well umm, maybe we could uhh... Ah-ha! Too slow!!",train
Phoebe Buffay,Ah-ha! Too cocky!,train
Joey Tribbiani,That was a great scene! And-and-and that slap looks so real! How do you do that?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh anyway, I just wanted to say how wonderful I think you are.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Say what?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"No. No, I'm Joey Tribbiani; we did a scene together yesterday. I-I'm the guy in the coma!",train

Joey Tribbiani,"Oh uh, one of the writers.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Umm...,train
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Ms. Monroe... Oh there you go.,train
Rachel Green,"No Phoebe! You cannot get the phone that way; that's not fair! Okay look, I have an idea. Why don't we, why don't we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial, and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him. And then whoever does gets the phone.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Or, we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone.",train
Rachel Green,I don't think so.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Fine all right, but I'd bet you'd be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet.",train
Rachel Green,"All right, first name on the speed dial is mom.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Ohh, I lost my mom to suicide.",train
Rachel Green,"Okay no way, you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.,train

Rachel Green,"Oh, I win! He's got Barney's on his speed dial.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"So you don't know that's Barney's the store! That can be y'know his friend's house, or a bar. Who has Barney's the store on their speed dial?",train
Rachel Green,His new girlfriend!,train
Monica Geller,What is that?,train
Chandler Bing,I think it's the dying cat parade.,train
Monica Geller,It sounds like it's coming from across the street.,train
Chandler Bing,Oh my God!,train

Joey Tribbiani,Joey.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh yeah-ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-l-l-l-l-l-look the-the-the only reason that I, that I came up to you before was because well, I'm really nervous about-about being you. Y'know if you can help me capture the essence of the character. Y'know? Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?",train

Monica Geller,That's what you say about porn.,train
Joey Tribbiani,You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.,train
Monica Geller,No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean the chance to star in a movie? Come on!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Well that's true. And I am only naked in one scene. Plus it sounds really great. My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl. Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm. So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other. It's really sweet and-and tender.,train
Monica Geller,"Plus, everyone's gonna see your thing.",train

Monica Geller,Yeah?,train
Chandler Bing,"Technically we could have sex again. What do you think, bossy and domineering?!",train
Monica Geller,"The wedding is off, sloppy and immature!",train
Chandler Bing,That's me! Come on!,train

Monica Geller,Shrill?! The wedding is back on!,train
Chandler Bing,Hi! Nice to meet you!,train
Monica Geller,"So, are you ready to go?",train
Monica Geller,Chandler!,train
Chandler Bing,I'll be right with you.,train
Monica Geller,Cassie needs to stay at your place.,train
Ross Geller,What-why?,train
Monica Geller,Because Purvry Perverson over here can't stop staring at her.,train
Ross Geller,What?! Chandler she's our cousin!,train
Chandler Bing,I was not staring at her. Okay? I was just listening intently. It's called being a good conversationalist. Watch. Say something.,train
Monica Geller,You were staring about eight inches south of there.,train
Ross Geller,"Fine, she can stay at my place. By the way, what-what does Cassie even look like now.",train
Monica Geller,She looks exactly like Aunt Marilyn.,train
Chandler Bing,"Umm, so this Aunt Marilyn is-is-is-is she coming to the wedding?",train
Monica Geller,Wafer thin ice!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I'm back!",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh so, will-will I be reading the same scene again?",train

Joey Tribbiani,Yep.,train
Monica Geller,But you told them you weren't?,train
Joey Tribbiani,That's right.,train
Monica Geller,Wow! Wow! And it's definitely all gone? There's nothing there to work with? What were you thinking?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know! I really want this part! And they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes. Like if-if they want you to ride a horse, you tell 'em you can! And just figure out how to do it later.",train
Monica Geller,Joey! This is not like learning to ride a horse! This is like learning to...grow a turtleneck!,train
Joey Tribbiani,I kn-I know! I know! Okay? And apparently tomorrow when I go in to meet the director I have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like.,train
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, what are you gonna do?!",train
Joey Tribbiani,I just have to call my agent and tell her I can't do the part.,train
Monica Geller,Unless!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Unless what?,train
Monica Geller,"Well, this may sound crazy, but there maybe something we could fashion.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Like what?,train
Monica Geller,"Well I'm not sure yet, but umm of the top of my head I'm thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey! I've got a great idea for party favors for the shower. Okay, we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone's names in them and inside is everyone's individual birth stone.",train
Rachel Green,"Okay. Okay. All right, you take care of that. And meanwhile, the party is tomorrow and we still don't have a guest list.",train

Monica Geller,"Okay. All right, turkey. Eh, that won't work. Cheese? That won't work. Olive loaf? I hope that won't work.",train
Rachel Green,Are you makin' him a sandwich?,train
Monica Geller,"No it's umm, more like a wrap. Okay so uh, I'm gonna go guys.",train
Monica Geller,I guess you can get back to deciding on what to get me for a present!,train
Rachel Green,We have to get her a present?!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Okay but look! Look at what I got! It's her address book! We have a guest list!,train
Rachel Green,Oh my God you're amazing! Did you just pull that out of her purse?,train

Ross Geller,"Well I'm, I'm a little slow. Just as our children would be.",train

Monica Geller,"Now, these are-are more realistic, but perishable.",train

Forget it. I want it. She wants it. I'm going in.",train
Ross Geller,"Say something clever! Okay, doesn't have to be clever, it just has to be words. Say some words. Any words will do. Oh my God! This is the longest that anyone has not talked ever!

Monica Geller,"Well, what am I going to say?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know. Just uh, just tell 'em it was a mix-up with the invitations, or-No-no-no! Blame it on the post office. They hate the post office. And the Irish! But I don't think you can blame it on them so...",train
Monica Geller,"Hello? Yeah, hi! Mrs. Tribbiani? Hi, this is Monica Geller. Yeah I'm just calling to say that Chandler and I uh, really hope you can make it to the wedding.

Monica Geller,You wanted it to be a surprise.,train
Chandler Bing,Oh my God.,train

Joey Tribbiani,How?! When?!,train
Chandler Bing,It happened in London.,train

Joey Tribbiani,"Yes, but y'know what? It doesn't matter who knows what. Now, enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know! Then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Or, we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own",train
Rachel Green,"All right honey, we'd better go if we wanna catch that movie.",train
Monica Geller,Bye!,train

Monica Geller,"Because he's terrible! Okay, he's slow, he burns things, last night he lit my pastry chef on fire!",train

Monica Geller,"Well, now she has no eyebrows, mission accomplished.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"But Monica, he loves his job so much! Can you just give him another chance? Please?",train
Monica Geller,"All right, but if-if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there!",train

Rachel Green,What?!,train
Joey Tribbiani,What? I...I just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people.,train
Rachel Green,"Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?",train
Joey Tribbiani,I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.,train
Rachel Green,"Good-good, don't tell him. Don't tell him. Just have him call me okay?",train

Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,train
Monica Geller,"Hey. Okay, I gave him another chance, but Tim has got to go!",train

Phoebe Buffay,"Okay. Okay, but you can't fire him today.",train
Monica Geller,Why not?!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Because I'm dumping him today.,train

Monica Geller,Just don't pick up your phone.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Then he comes over! ""I'm so worried about you."" Uck! Be a man!",train
Monica Geller,What? So now I'm not allowed to fire him?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"You can't fire him and dump him the same day, he'll kill himself.",train
Monica Geller,"Okay well then, I'll fire him today and you go out with him for another week.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Are you kidding?! Another week with that sip, I'll kill myself!",train
Monica Geller,"Okay well, then we'll both do it today and he'll just have to deal with it!",train
Phoebe Buffay,Okay. But the question is who's gonna go first. 'Cause whoever goes second is the bitch.,train
Monica Geller,What do you mean?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Come on! The boss that fires a guy that's just been dumped, bitch! And the woman who dumps a guy that's just been fired, blond bitch!",train

Phoebe Buffay,"All right, that makes sense. Ugh. But-Screw you I'm going first!",train
Chandler Bing,"Sure, what's up?",train
Rachel Green,"Hey, what do you think is a better excuse for why I'm not drinking on this date tonight. ""Umm, I'm a recovering alcoholic. I'm a Mormon,"" or ""I got so hammered last night I'm still a little drunk?""",train
Ross Geller,Hey!,train

Joey Tribbiani,It's no Ukrainian film.,train
Rachel Green,Yeah-Ooh! Earrings!,train

Ross Geller,Joey what-what were you thinking?!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I was thinking that it'd probably be okay because Ross hasn't gone out with Rachel in five years!",train
Ross Geller,"Joey, I'm not worried about her! I'm worried about my baby! Whoever she dates my baby dates! Now-now where is this actor taking them?",train
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! I'm an actor too! I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry out to some Italian place on Staten Island.,train
Ross Geller,A ferry? My baby is going on a ferry? Do you have any idea how dangerous those are?!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour?,train

Ross Geller,I don't know! I guess I just can't believe any of this is happening.,train
Joey Tribbiani,What do you mean?,train
Ross Geller,"It's just I always thought when I had another kid it would be different. Now I-I love Ben, but every time I have to drop him off at Carol and Susan's, it's like-It breaks my heart a little. I mean I've always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday and, my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed. And we all read the paper together. Y'know? Maybe fight over the science section.",train
Joey Tribbiani,That's a nice picture. Maybe you can still have that!,train
Ross Geller,No! No I can't. I mean Rachel's out with some guy. My baby went with her. If anything that picture keeps moving further away.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, can I ask you something? In this, in this picture of you and your wife, is your wife Rachel?",train
Ross Geller,It used to be. Now she doesn't really have a face. Smokin' body though.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Good call. Yeah. But, the face Ross, the face isn't Rachel.",train
Ross Geller,No but ahh! How much easier would it be if it were?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, but I don't think that's what she wants.",train

Joey Tribbiani,"That's okay Ross maybe you need a new picture. Okay? It's not gonna be what you thought, but no matter what there's gonna be a brand new little baby, your baby. Who cares what the picture looks like?",train

Chandler Bing,"No, it wasn't you.",train
Monica Geller,Well then who?,train
Chandler Bing,I got a maid. Yay!,train

Chandler Bing,"Look, she's really nice. Okay? And she mentioned that she adored the way that you arranged the sponges.",train
Monica Geller,Did she really say that?,train

Monica Geller,"Fine, I can do it. Whew.",train
Chandler Bing,What's the matter?,train
Monica Geller,"Well, usually when I'm this anxious, I clean!",train

Rachel Green,I can't. I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.,train
Ross Geller,You're moving?,train
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I can't live with Joey once the baby comes. I don't want my child's first words to be, ""How you doin'?""",train
Ross Geller,So does-does Joey know you're moving?,train
Rachel Green,"Well, I haven't discussed it with him yet, but I know he's gonna be relieved. Last week, he brought this girl over and I started talking to her about morning sickness and then I showed her pictures from my pregnancy book.",train
Ross Geller,That's not really porn.,train
Rachel Green,Not so much.,train
Ross Geller,"Hey, y'know what and if you're looking for a place? I just heard in the elevator this morning that a woman in my building died.",train
Rachel Green,Oh my God! Was she old? Does she have a view?,train

Rachel Green,Yeah that would really be great.,train
Ross Geller,Yeah.,train

Ross Geller,What?,train
Ross Geller,"Oh, thank God!",train
Rachel Green,Ahh.,train
Ross Geller,"Of course! Uh yeah, she and I would talk all the time in-in the laundry room.",train
Ross Geller,Y'know I would it's just painful.,train
Rachel Green,So she's really not dead.,train
Rachel Green,"Hmm. Do you think-Could you tell me if she's hanging in, in a one bedroom or a two?",train

Monica Geller,Okay.,train
Chandler Bing,See? I told you.,train
Monica Geller,She stole my jeans!,train
Chandler Bing,What?,train
Monica Geller,I have been looking for them all week and she is wearing them!,train
Chandler Bing,So she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you?,train
Monica Geller,Don't you see? It's the perfect crime!,train
Chandler Bing,She must've been planning this for years!,train
Monica Geller,I will prove it to you! Okay? About a week ago I was wearing those jeans and I dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch. Now when she comes back I will find it and show you that stain!,train
Chandler Bing,"Honey, isn't it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair?",train
Monica Geller,I guess.,train
Chandler Bing,"So, shouldn't we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go...snooping around her crotch?",train
Monica Geller,Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give her my secret ingredient.,train
Chandler Bing,"Out of curiosity, what is your secret ingredient?",train
Monica Geller,Yeah!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, me too. Not in the shaky angry way you are though.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.,train
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. Yeah.,train
Phoebe Buffay,Maybe this is too weird.,train
Phoebe Buffay,No don't tear out your eyes!!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah try that. So, is that better?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Look Eric, turn around. Look, I like you, but it shouldn't be this hard. Y'know? This is our first date y'know? First dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and 'Ooh, he just touched my hand, did he mean to touch my hand?' and y'know first kisses and......second kisses.",train
Ross Geller,"Thanks for the coffee, or bedankt voor de koffie, Gunter.",train
Ross Geller,"Yeah, we're done.",train
Ross Geller,Ezel? Ezel? Ezel?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Ross! Listen, do you want to go see that new Imax movie on tide pools?",train

Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you're switching apartments?",train
Ross Geller,"It's not for me, it's for Rachel.",train
Joey Tribbiani,But Rachel has an apartment.,train
Ross Geller,"Yeah, but when the baby comes she's gonna want to move.",train
Joey Tribbiani,She is?,train
Ross Geller,"Yeah, you didn't expect her to live there with a baby did you?",train

Monica Geller,Nice jeans!,train
Monica Geller,Oh. You're not gettin' it.,train

Rachel Green,Oh.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh. So umm, I was talkin' to Ross and he said you were looking for a new place.",train
Rachel Green,Oh yeah! Hopefully across the street if certain Dutch people would just let go.,train
Joey Tribbiani,I was kinda hoping you'd stay.,train
Rachel Green,"Oh but Joey, I have to go. There's no room for a baby here.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"No room? It's a baby. It's like this big. Y'know, I mean you-you could you could put it over here. Or-or-or we could put it right here. Aw, it's cute, right? Or-or we could put it over here. You wouldn't even notice it. Where's the baby?",train
Rachel Green,"Honey, it's not just a matter of where you put it. I mean a baby changes everything. They cry all the time. I mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there's a screaming baby around.",train
Joey Tribbiani,I could use a challenge! It's getting pretty easy.,train
Rachel Green,"Honey, it's so sweet that you want me to stay, but I-I can't do that to you. I mean it would disrupt your entire life.",train
Joey Tribbiani,I love living with you so much. I just wish things didn't have to change.,train
Rachel Green,I know.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Y'know I blame Ross for this.,train
Rachel Green,I do too a little bit.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm gonna miss you, you're the hottest roommate I ever had.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, oh no! I have to go! I have a massage appointment.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I got in trouble for that before. I'll see you later.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Really? That's the thing I'm worse at! You'll see.,train
Chandler Bing,Hi!,train
Monica Geller,"Hey! Umm, I think Brenda needs a raise.",train
Chandler Bing,How come?,train
Monica Geller,Because I put my head between her legs.,train
Chandler Bing,To see her pants?,train
Monica Geller,They're my pants!,train
Chandler Bing,Are you sure? Did you see the stain?,train
Monica Geller,No! I was just getting into position and then everything went dark.,train
Chandler Bing,"God! She is not stealing from us! Okay, will you let this go?",train
Monica Geller,Fine. She's wearing my bra!,train
Chandler Bing,Oh dear God!,train
Monica Geller,My pink flowered bra! I recognize the strap!,train

Chandler Bing,Here's another plan...No!,train
Monica Geller,I would do it but she thinks I'm attracted to her!,train
Chandler Bing,Why?,train
Monica Geller,Did you not hear where my head was? Come on! Come on we're a team! We're in this together!,train
Chandler Bing,I fear a jury will see it the same way!,train
Monica Geller,"Do this for me! Come on, I catch you looking at woman's breasts all the time!",train
Chandler Bing,You see that?,train
Monica Geller,Do you see this?,train
Chandler Bing,All right. Yes. Okay. I get your point. But if it's not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment?!,train

Rachel Green,You're so sweet. Oh my God! And you gave the baby Hugsy!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Ahhhhhhhhhhhh.... That-that-that's really just to show where the baby would go. Y'know why don't I hold on to him so that there's no confusion?,train
Rachel Green,"But Joey the baby is going to be crying, it's going to be loud.",train
Joey Tribbiani,I'm loud!,train
Rachel Green,It's gonna be up all night!,train
Joey Tribbiani,I'm up all night!,train
Rachel Green,It's gonna poop!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Hello!,train
Rachel Green,What about all the women you want to bring home?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, if I'm bringing home a woman who can't stand being around a baby, then maybe I don't want to be with that woman! Or maybe we'll just do it in the bathroom of the club!",train
Rachel Green,"Joey, are you sure?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! All right-Look, I know sometimes it'll be hard, okay? But, it'll also be really...really great. Please Rachel! I-I-I really want you to stay.",train

Rachel Green,No Phoebe! I just need you there for support. I haven't told him I'm pregnant yet.,train
Phoebe Buffay,Oh. Why not?,train
Rachel Green,'Cause I know he's gonna flip out and I hate it when he's angry.,train

Joey Tribbiani,It's a grand tradition!,train
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, they surprised me. There was nothing I could do!",train
Rachel Green,Well you could've untied it with your hands.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"This is so unfair! The one thing I wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party, but no, I wasn't allowed to. All I got was a stupid steak dinner!",train
Chandler Bing,You went home with the waitress.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, that was a pretty good night.",train
Chandler Bing,I can't believe you didn't tell me! You know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty!,train

Phoebe Buffay,Rachel!,train
Rachel Green,"No it's okay, this is what's gonna happen. I'm gonna wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Why, so he can get mad at the baby?",train
Rachel Green,"Hey, that is the...baby's problem. Oh, everything okay with the waiter?",train
Rachel Green,"Well... Umm, I got TiVo.",train
Phoebe Buffay,It's slang for pregnant.,train
Rachel Green,Phoebe!,train
Rachel Green,"Well uh, yes and no. Except not no. So to sum it up, yeah.",train

Chandler Bing,Honey! That's crazy! I don't want you to get me a stripper...,train
Joey Tribbiani,Will you let the lady talk?!,train
Monica Geller,"Come on! Come on, it'll be fun! It'll make me feel so much better.",train
Chandler Bing,"Look, I appreciate it, but uh, it's a little creepy. Y'know? I'm not a bachelor anymore.",train
Monica Geller,"So don't think of it as a bachelor party, think of it as a...a two month anniversary present.",train
Ross Geller,"Sure, one year is paper, but two months is lapdance!",train
Monica Geller,Please! I feel so bad! Just watch the hot woman get naked!,train
Chandler Bing,All right fine! But I'm only doing this for you!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah!,train
Chandler Bing,And Joey.,train

Rachel Green,"All right here he comes. I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna tell him, I'm gonna be strong.",train
Rachel Green,Yeah?,train
Rachel Green,"Really?! The Plaza?!! Oh daddy!! Right. Daddy, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down.",train
Rachel Green,There's not gonna be a wedding. Ross and I are not getting married.,train

Rachel Green,"Oh now daddy, stay calm. Please.",train
Rachel Green,"Yes. Yes, he says I'm damaged goods.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"So you uh, nervous about getting married?",train
Chandler Bing,What are you doing?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, look let's pretend it's a real bachelor party. Okay? Y'know? Before your wedding. Come on, it'll be fun.",train
Chandler Bing,Okay. I can't believe tomorrow's the big day.,train
Joey Tribbiani,How does it feel knowing you're never gonna be with another woman again huh? Knowing you're gonna have to wake up to the same face everyday until you finally have the sweet release of death.,train
Chandler Bing,"You're right, this is more fun.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"That's her! Okay, come on!",train
Chandler Bing,Hi.,train

Ross Geller,"No! No sir umm, she means a lot to me. I mean, I care-I-I love Rachel.",train
Ross Geller,"Oh but not that way. I mean...I mean I'm not in love with her. I love her like a, like a friend.",train
Ross Geller,Hey! I offered to marry her!,train
Ross Geller,But I didn't want to.,train
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry. Dr. Green, Mona. Mona, Dr. Green.",train
Chandler Bing,I can't believe there is a naked hooker in there!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Wait! Wait! Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper, but she got confused about what she's supposed to do.",train
Chandler Bing,"Could be. I mean technically she did strip, we just, we just missed it. Ma'am, are you also a stripper?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Maybe Monica's playing a joke on ya. Y'know? Getting her own husband a hooker, that's pretty funny.",train
Chandler Bing,"That is funny, maybe for my birthday she'll murder someone.",train
Joey Tribbiani,I bet Ross was in on it too. I mean he was conveniently busy.,train
Chandler Bing,"Oh actually, I'd rather you...Yeah, go ahead. We're gonna have to burn that room down anyway.",train
Ross Geller,"I was going to tell you, but...",train
Ross Geller,Hey! I did not dump Rachel! Nor are we still together. Can I just... Why don't we just let the machine get that?,train

Monica Geller,She's a stripper.,train
Monica Geller,"Is that, is that what they call strippers sometimes?",train
Monica Geller,Oh my God Stu! I-I can't believe you did this! Now are you absolutely sure she's a hooker?,train
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.,train
Chandler Bing,Why would she do that?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Maybe she wants you to learn something. Huh? Now is there anything you're really bad at y'know, sexually?",train
Chandler Bing,This is the worst bachelor party ever!,train
Joey Tribbiani,In a minute!,train
Chandler Bing,In a minute? What's gonna happen in a minute?!,train
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, all right maybe-maybe you should just ask her to leave.",train
Chandler Bing,Why me?!,train

Rachel Green,Remember I had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken?,train
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. But I thought that was because I put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table.,train

Monica Geller,"Hmm, a little relieved, I gotta say.",train

Rachel Green,"Monica, how come you never told me this?!",train

Phoebe Buffay,I wanna join!,train
Rachel Green,Wh-Phoebe!!,train

Rachel Green,"All right, y'know-Fine! You guys have your stupid little club, but I would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what I did to you! You gave me a tiney-wienie!",train
Monica Geller,"All right, listen you're just being silly. Rachel, even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you. One girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a Tootsie Roll!",train
Rachel Green,Wow...,train
Monica Geller,"And Ross, if it weren't for Rachel's rumor I mean no one in high school would even know who you were. She put you on the map!",train

Monica Geller,"Anyway, I picked up this outfit that I want to wear and the, and the boots don't really go with it.",train

Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, thank you. Four would be great.",train

Rachel Green,Really?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Dina, if you're having a baby you should be married! Even if it is to Bobby! Dude, that's not a compliment!",train
Joey Tribbiani,So whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! What are you gonna do? You're gonna have the baby and-and raise it by yourself...without a husband?! You can't be a single mother alone! You're gonna ruin your life!,train
Rachel Green,Oh excuse me! Am I ruining my life?,train
Joey Tribbiani,No! No! No! It's different for you. You're so strong and together. You're not some dumb kid who doesn't know what she's doing.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"One pregnant woman at a time, please! I just want you to be okay.",train

Joey Tribbiani,"Maybe! Well! Well...so-so uh, what kind of music does Numb Nuts-Oh forget it! I can't!",train

Phoebe Buffay,Then that's not breaking the law! I'm there!,train
Rachel Green,,train
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?,train
Rachel Green,"Look at that guy by the window, wow!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"He's awfully short and I think he's talking to himself. And to be completely honest, he's not that good in bed.",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, what is wrong with me lately? I mean it's like every guy I see-I mean look here. Look at that guy for example, I mean normally that's not someone I would-would be attracted to, but right now, with the way I'm feeling, all I want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack.",train

Rachel Green,Uh Ross? You asked me that.,train
Ross Geller,"Hey! You were a closed book! Okay? I'm not a mind reader! Besides, I hate those conversations. I'm horrible at them. Really! Maybe-maybe I need kind of a gesture. Y'know, something that says we're moving forward without having to talk about it.",train

Monica Geller,Come here. I can breath through my mouth.,train

Rachel Green,Oh. It's gotta be rough.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, it is. It's really tough. Y'know sometimes I think-Wow!! Nice move!",train

Monica Geller,"Chandler, why would you do that?",train
Chandler Bing,Because it's awesome.,train
Monica Geller,You think this is clever?,train
Chandler Bing,"Well y'know, they only give you three letters, so after A-S-S it is a bit of a challenge.",train
Monica Geller,"Hey wait a minute, this one isn't dirty.",train
Chandler Bing,It is when you put it together with that one.,train
Monica Geller,"Ah, well if you don't clear this off, you won't be getting one of those from me. But Ben's coming over here tomorrow to play this game, this can't be there.",train
Chandler Bing,"Come on, he won't even know what they mean.",train
Monica Geller,Chandler! He's seven; he's not stupid.,train
Chandler Bing,Have you talked to him lately?,train
Monica Geller,"All right, look I'm just gonna unplug it.",train
Chandler Bing,"No-no-no, if you unplug it, I'll have nothing to show for my day! It would be like I was at work. No! Hey look at that! Look at that, it's still there! This thing must have some kind of primitive ROM Chip in it or something!",train
Monica Geller,Honey you-you got to beat your scores!,train
Chandler Bing,With the claw?!,train
Monica Geller,"All right fine. Fine, I'll do it. I've just got to get this off the screen. Carol and Susan are still upset that you taught him pull my finger.",train

Rachel Green,I know!,train
Joey Tribbiani,I never laughed so hard-Did you see the wine come out of my nose?,train
Rachel Green,"Joey, I think everyone saw the wine come out of your nose.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy the non-sex part of the date so much.",train
Rachel Green,Well that is because you have never been on a date with me before.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Huh. Huh.,train
Rachel Green,"All right, now don't judge me. I normally wait until my date leaves, but you live here. I'm ripping into this swan.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah! Okay, well then you don't judge me. I'm gonna suck on the cellophane from the brownie I had before.",train
Rachel Green,"So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's end of the night moves?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, well, if I want the girl to kiss me, first thing I do is make my lips look irresistible.",train

Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, like a moth to a flame, I'm telling ya. Okay all right, so now you go.",train
Rachel Green,"No, I don't want to tell you.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Why not?,train
Rachel Green,Because it's embarrassing.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"More embarrassing than shiny raspberry lip balm?! I didn't say raspberry before did I? All right just-just tell me Rach, just tell me!",train
Rachel Green,"Okay. All right, stand up. Well, when we're at the door, I lightly press my lips against his, and then move into his body just for a second, and then I make this sound, ""Hmmm."" Okay, I know it doesn't sound like anything, but I swear it works.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Why-Yeah, that would work for ya...",train
Rachel Green,"All right, I gotta go to bed. Honey, I had such a wonderful time.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Oh. Yeah. Me to.,train
Rachel Green,"...you were 50 minutes late to the class, what did you crawl there?!",train

Rachel Green,"Well, why didn't you just take a cab?",train
Ross Geller,"Ugh, between the traffic that time of day and all the one-way streets it'll take me twice as long. Besides, I teach the class three times a week, who am I? Rockefeller?",train
Rachel Green,Well you're not gonna be able to keep doing this.,train
Ross Geller,"Well I have to. Okay? If I don't, they'll take the class away from me. And...I already put it in my family newsletter.",train

Rachel Green,Relax! It's not like it's Citizen Kane!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Have you ever tried to sit through Citizen Kane?,train

Ross Geller,"Yeah!!!! Yes, I made it! I'm on time! Okay, why don't we all uh, open our books to page 23. Where... Where you will see...a uh...a bunch of uh...red spots. Okay, umm, why don't, why don't you all start to read, while I-",train
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no! I'm fine. It's just... Hey, can I ask you something? Have you ever looked at someone that you've known for a while and then suddenly...suddenly see them a different way?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Yeah, that...that's exactly it. You're right. Yeah.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh! Yeah. So yeah, so you know exactly what I'm talking about.",train

Joey Tribbiani,"Well, neither.",train
Chandler Bing,"Oh my God, what's up?!",train

Chandler Bing,"Oh no-no, no you don't, just come back.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"All right. Okay. You and Monica, friends for a long time, and sure there are rules, but then you went to London. Oh, no, but that's different. I mean, there are rules there, too! You know what I mean?",train
Chandler Bing,Do you?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"It was different for you guys! I mean, I mean, you were both in the same place, right?",train
Chandler Bing,In London?,train
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.,train
Chandler Bing,"Yes. When Monica and I were in London, we were both in London.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"You know what? This is a bad idea. Forget it. Forget it, and listen, do me a favor, this conversation was between you and me.",train
Chandler Bing,If that.,train
Rachel Green,"Hi! Oh, Ross, don't forget, we have that doctor's appointment tomorrow!",train
Ross Geller,Right.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, are you going to find out the sex of the baby?",train

Ross Geller,And smart!,train
Rachel Green,Popular.,train
Ross Geller,With an aptitude for science.,train
Phoebe Buffay,Are you two talking about the same baby? Hey! Have you started off thinking of names yet?,train

Phoebe Buffay,Me too!,train
Rachel Green,Really?!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh huh! If it's a girl, Phoebe, and if it's a boy, Phoebo!",train
Ross Geller,"Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt to have a backup, you know? Uh, Rach-Rach, what were you thinking?",train
Rachel Green,"Okay! I was thinking if it's a girl, how about Sandrine? It's French.",train
Ross Geller,Huh. That's a really pretty name for-for an industrial solvent.,train
Rachel Green,"Okay fine, what do you have?",train
Ross Geller,"Well, OK, it's for a boy. Well, I know it's a little out there, but...Darwin.",train
Rachel Green,"Wow, oh my God, our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, by Sandrine.",train
Ross Geller,You're just saying that 'cause I said no to your name!,train
Rachel Green,"I'm really, really not.",train
Phoebe Buffay,How-how about you each get five vetoes?,train
Ross Geller,All right.,train
Rachel Green,All right.,train
Ross Geller,That sounds fair.,train
Rachel Green,"Yeah! I don't think you're going to need it though. Okay, check this out. If it's a girl, Rain.",train
Ross Geller,Veto.,train
Rachel Green,Why?,train
Ross Geller,"Rain? Hi. Hi, my name is Rain. I have my own kiln, and my dress is made out of wheat.",train

Chandler Bing,Hey.,train
Monica Geller,"Boy, do I have a surprise for you!",train
Chandler Bing,Sex on the balcony?,train
Monica Geller,"No, but someone's really not going to get over that idea, are they?",train
Chandler Bing,What is it?,train
Monica Geller,I drew you a bath!,train
Chandler Bing,"Honey, I don't like baths! Could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony?",train
Monica Geller,"Please, could you just try it for me? Come on, I used all my best stuff! I-I-I lit some candles. I put on some music. I used bath salts, plus bubble bath! And got you this little plastic Navy ship. So it's a boy bath!",train
Chandler Bing,"Well, this does butch it up a bit.",train
Monica Geller,"I swear, if you try it, you will love it!",train
Chandler Bing,"All right, if I do this, can we at least discuss sex on the balcony?",train
Monica Geller,Absolutely.,train
Monica Geller,Bet I know how that discussion's going to go.,train
Chandler Bing,"All right, this isn't so bad. I like the flower smell! Which is okay, because I've got my boat.",train
Monica Geller,So?,train
Chandler Bing,Oh my God.,train
Monica Geller,"I told you you were a bath person! Hey, when you get out, maybe I can give you a facial!",train
Chandler Bing,I'm going to need a bigger boat.,train
Ross Geller,"I don't think you had an open mind about the name Ruth. I mean, come on, little Ruthie Geller, how-how cute is that?",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, oh my God! I can practically hear the mahjong tiles!",train
Ross Geller,"Uh, no. No, we're not.",train
Rachel Green,But you have it right there in that file? You could tell us whether it's a boy or a girl? Dayton or Sandrine? Phoebe or Phoebo?,train
Ross Geller,"No, no, we want to wait, right?",train
Rachel Green,Right. Right.,train
Rachel Green,"So, which of these babies do you think is the ugliest?",train

Rachel Green,Third one from the left?,train

Rachel Green,What?!,train
Ross Geller,You're looking!,train
Rachel Green,I didn't!,train
Ross Geller,I saw you!,train

Ross Geller,Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!,train
Rachel Green,"Okay, but Ross just listen to me...",train
Ross Geller,"No, no, no, no! Don't tell me! I don't want to know!",train
Rachel Green,"But I couldn't even if I wanted to, because I don't know! I swear; I didn't see anything, and I don't want to know! It was just a momentary lapse.",train
Ross Geller,Momentary lapse. Don't-don't you have any self-control?,train
Rachel Green,"Okay, a couple months late on the lecture, Ross.",train
Monica Geller,Hello?,train
Chandler Bing,"I'm in the bathroom, can you come in here? I think there's something wrong.",train
Monica Geller,You know what? I-I think I'll wait out here.,train
Chandler Bing,I'm in the bathtub.,train
Monica Geller,Oh. What's wrong?,train
Chandler Bing,"I drew my own bath, but I did it wrong! The water's tepid. The salt didn't dissolve and is now... lodged places. And the scents I used don't compliment each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile-Oh!",train
Monica Geller,What?,train
Chandler Bing,The bath salts! They're starting to effervesce! It's different. It's interesting.,train
Monica Geller,"Okay, let's talk about something else.",train
Chandler Bing,"Yeah! Sure, sure. So, what was going on with you today? Oh-oh-oh!",train
Monica Geller,"Well, I actually had the weirdest conversation with Joey. He was talking about rules and right and wrong and...",train
Chandler Bing,I had the exact same conversation.,train
Monica Geller,You did? What was he talking about?,train
Chandler Bing,I don't know! Joey hasn't had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in Macbeth!,train
Monica Geller,That was a long night.,train
Chandler Bing,"All right, let's break this down. What exactly did he say to you?",train
Monica Geller,"Okay, he was talking about rules.",train
Chandler Bing,Uh-huh.,train
Monica Geller,"Umm, and looking at people differently.",train
Chandler Bing,He didn't say anything about that to me.,train
Monica Geller,What did he tell you?,train
Chandler Bing,"He was asking all these questions about you, me, and London. And, of course the glue that holds this all together, the rules.",train
Monica Geller,"Okay. So you, me and London. Looking at people differently. Maybe he wants to do what you and I did in London with someone.",train
Chandler Bing,But what did he mean by rules?,train
Monica Geller,Wait a minute! He stopped talking the minute Phoebe came in!,train
Chandler Bing,Because he was looking at her differently.,train
Monica Geller,"And Phoebe is his friend, so he thinks that would be breaking the rules!",train
Chandler Bing,My God! He wants to do it with Phoebe in London!,train
Phoebe Buffay,You guys?,train
Monica Geller,Just a minute! That's Mrs. Tribbiani!,train
Chandler Bing,You don't say anything.,train
Monica Geller,"Why would I say anything? That two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives! And they would have me to thank, and we could all start having babies?",train
Chandler Bing,I'm not going to let you say anything.,train
Monica Geller,You just stay here!,train
Chandler Bing,"Oh, God!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, hey, Monica, I brought back your iron.",train

Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.,train
Monica Geller,"I thought I lost it. I got a new one, like, a month ago.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, just as well, I broke this one.",train
Phoebe Buffay,What?,train
Monica Geller,Nothing.,train
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.,train
Monica Geller,"I mean, I-I, I really shouldn't say. I mean, I'm really not supposed to.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Fine.,train
Monica Geller,It's a humdinger!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Then it's really too bad that you can't tell me.,train
Monica Geller,Somebody likes you!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Is it Chandler?,train
Monica Geller,No!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, then tell him to stop staring!",train
Monica Geller,It's Joey!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Really?! Joey?! You don't say.,train
Monica Geller,Is it something you'd be interested in?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. You know, I mean, on the one hand, Mother may I? But y'know on the other hand... No. No, I can't. We're friends. No, oh, no. I don't want to risk what we have.",train
Monica Geller,"I guess that makes sense. So, you think you're going to talk to him?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Sure, yeah. I mean, it's Joey. I don't want him to get hurt. Well, I must say, I am on fire! First Chandler, now Joey!",train
Monica Geller,"Not Chandler, just Joey.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Sure.,train
Rachel Green,Hey.,train
Ross Geller,Hey.,train
Rachel Green,You know what? I've been thinking about it. I'm really coming around on the name Ruth. I think I would actually consider naming our child that.,train
Ross Geller,"Rach, I-I can't tell you how-how much that means to me! Ohh... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You-you hated the name Ruth! Why-why would you change your mind? Unless, you know we're never going to have to use it. You did see the folder. You know it's a boy!",train
Rachel Green,I didn't see anything! I actually changed my mind about the name.,train
Ross Geller,"I don't think so! You're just giving me Ruth so you'll get to name it when it's a boy, and that's when you'll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.",train
Rachel Green,I would-Sequoia?,train
Ross Geller,Veto.,train
Rachel Green,Fine.,train
Ross Geller,"Unless... You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl, and you really do want her to be named Ruth! Well, I'm not falling for that! Okay? Ruth is off the table!",train
Rachel Green,"But Ross, you want the name Ruth!",train
Ross Geller,Not like this!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey. Well, what's up?",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Umm, Joey, I know.",train
Joey Tribbiani,What?,train
Phoebe Buffay,I knooow.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Whaaat?,train
Phoebe Buffay,I know about your feelings.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God. You do?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, and I'm sorry. I-I know things worked out for Chandler and Monica, but that's very rare.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"I know. I know. And this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys. I mean, it's Rachel for God sakes.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"For God sakes, it's Rachel!",train
Joey Tribbiani,I know. I know. And she's not only my friend; she's my pregnant friend! She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah that's Rachel. Beat me over the head with it.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"What am I going to do? You know, and I keep, I keep trying to get rid of these feelings, y'know? I stayed up all last night and made a list of everything I don't like about her. You want to hear it?",train
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"She made me switch to light Mayo. That's it! That's all I got! And, you know what? It tastes the same and my pants fit better!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, I just think you're getting worked up over nothing. This is probably just a crush.",train
Joey Tribbiani,You think?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Absolutely! Y'know, you get this rush of feelings, but then it goes away.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, just a crush! That's all this is! It's a crush! I'm Joey; I don't get deep feelings.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"That's right, there you go! Crushes happen all the time! I know I've had them for all you guys. Well, except for Ross and Chandler. And I'm sure you've had them for us.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Not really.,train
Phoebe Buffay,Mm-hmm. Throw me a bone here.,train
Ross Geller,"So, I uh... I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby.",train
Rachel Green,What?,train
Ross Geller,That's right. The student has become the master.,train
Rachel Green,"Ross, I swear, I don't know.",train
Ross Geller,"Oh, come on, you know it's a girl!",train
Rachel Green,A what?!,train
Ross Geller,You really didn't know?,train
Rachel Green,We're having a girl?,train
Ross Geller,No.,train
Rachel Green,That's what you just said!,train
Ross Geller,No.,train
Rachel Green,You said girl!,train
Ross Geller,Yes. I'm... I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.,train
Rachel Green,I'm not! We're having a girl! Sometimes I can't believe it's with you-But still! We're having a girl!,train
Ross Geller,I know! I know. You know what? I'm putting Ruth back on the table!,train
Rachel Green,"Oh, yes! We'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth...",train
Ross Geller,Permission to veto.,train
Rachel Green,"Yes, please.",train

Monica Geller,"Yeah, I'm going to take a bath. I'm just going to get a magazine.",train
Chandler Bing,Okay.,train
Monica Geller,What do you think you're doing?,train
Chandler Bing,L-leaving my troubles behind?,train
Monica Geller,"I know that you're new at this, but this is completely unacceptable bath decorum.",train
Chandler Bing,"Oh, it's so hard to care when you're this relaxed.",train
Monica Geller,"Fine, you can have the bath, but I am taking your boat. Now you're just a girl in a tub!",train
Chandler Bing,Hey!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Hi, Bubbles. Manly. Well, I just thought I would drop by and let you know how it went with Joey.",train
Chandler Bing,You told her?!,train
Monica Geller,She pulled it out of me! She's like a conversational wizard! How'd it go?,train

Chandler Bing,"So, how's the hideously inappropriate crush on Rachel coming?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, really good. Really good. Yeah, I should be ready to kill myself any day now. Wow, you sure found that quick. I just-I wish I didn't feel this way about Rachel anymore, y'know? I wish things could go back to normal. I mean, I love living with her and God, helping out with the baby is just amazing, but now I think...I think Ross feels left out. Y'know? When I had to take Rachel to the hospital, the doctor thought I was the father. God... You should've seen the look on Ross's face. By the way, I have no idea what I'm doing here. For all I know I'm just locking it more. Oh hey, did you try opening it with a credit card?",train
Chandler Bing,That's a good idea.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.,train
Chandler Bing,"Okay. So uh, Ross is kinda bummed huh?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I just...I feel terrible.",train
Chandler Bing,"Well, it's not your fault. What are you gonna do? Not take her to the hospital? Y'know? You're doing nothing wrong. Except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby. Richard? If-if you're in there, could you pass me my credit card?",train
Monica Geller,Hey.,train

Rachel Green,"Yeah, I'll be fine. But could someone please make sure that sandwich is gone when I get out there?",train
Joey Tribbiani,I'm on it!,train
Ross Geller,I can't believe this! I shouldn't be the one making her throw up!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Dude relax! It could happen to anyone.,train
Ross Geller,"Yeah? Not to you, because you know this stuff. I don't know any of it and I'm the father. I wish I'd be more involved y'know.",train

Chandler Bing,Are you okay?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Are you kidding me? I'm great! Yeah, I'm uh; I'm better than great. I am good. And now that she's gone, I can uh, I can do all this stuff around here that I couldn't do before.

Ross Geller,"Oh, no, no, no, I will! I just want to butter her up, first! You know, I'm going to take her to an amazing Valentine's dinner.

Phoebe Buffay,"she's a lucky, lucky lady! So, where are you going to-what the mother of crap is up with this stuff? Oh, God. Is it gum, is it food? What's the deal? Oh, it's nice! May I try a pink one?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"So, between her and me being friends, and her history with Ross, it just isn't going to happen. It would be like you falling in love with a cat.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, buddy. How's my favorite dog, huh? How's my favorite dog? You're subdued. Did you give him a beer?",train

Joey Tribbiani,He's breathing!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I'm going to take him back to Wendy's.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no, no! He's fine! Look, look, look! Here's your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! Get your ball! My God, what have I done to you, huh? I broke the dog! Pheebs, I broke the dog!",train

Monica Geller,How long has it been this time?,train
Chandler Bing,90 seconds.,train
Monica Geller,That's better. 90 seconds is a long time not to think about it...except all I did was think about it.,train
Chandler Bing,"You know, it haunts me? Up 'til now, the worst thing I ever saw, was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy. After this, I would gladly make that my screensaver!",train
Monica Geller,"Okay, well, we have to get past this! Why don't we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed?",train
Chandler Bing,I can do that.,train
Monica Geller,Okay.,train
Chandler Bing,Okay. Now all we've got to do is get rid of this chair.,train
Monica Geller,"Oh, thank God!",train
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I know!",train
Monica Geller,Come in!,train
Rachel Green,"Hi! I'm so sorry to barge in on your Valentine's, but I had to get away from all the yelling. Mona is dumping Ross.",train

Ross Geller,Uh...Mona just dumped me.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, man, I'm sorry. Why?",train
Ross Geller,"Well, with everything that's been going on lately, I haven't exactly been the perfect boyfriend. You know, I, uh, I didn't tell her I got Rachel pregnant. I gave her a key to my apartment, and then had the locks changed! And then I lied to her about Rachel moving in with me. In a way, I actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner, you know?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Still, that really sucks, man. Especially on Valentine's Day.",train
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Joey Tribbiani without a date on Valentine's Day? What's going on, huh? Girl trouble?",train

Joey Tribbiani,You don't have to seem so happy about it.,train
Ross Geller,"Oh, sorry. Well, look, maybe I can help you with it.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I...I d-",train
Ross Geller,"Hey, whatever it is, I am sure it has happened to me. Y'know, actually once-once I got dumped during sex.",train
Ross Geller,"Anyway, so, uh, so what is it?",train
Joey Tribbiani,Forget about it. It's no big deal.,train
Ross Geller,C'mon! Joey! What is it?,train
Joey Tribbiani,It's nothing.,train
Ross Geller,"Hey, hey, it's me. Why can't you tell me?",train

Ross Geller,She's not a Tribbiani?,train
Joey Tribbiani,No!,train
Ross Geller,"I knew it. So, is she someone from work?",train
Joey Tribbiani,Yes.,train
Ross Geller,"Well, uh, does she like you?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Sometimes I think maybe she could. But it doesn't matter, because I can't do anything about it.",train
Ross Geller,Why not?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. Someone from work, too. And I could never do that to the guy, because we're really good friends.",train
Ross Geller,"So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh... is he still in love with her?",train
Joey Tribbiani,No. I don't think so.,train
Ross Geller,Okay. Um... is he a good guy?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, he's the best.",train

Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah.",train
Ross Geller,"Anyway... seriously, uh...just...just talk to the guy, okay? And tell me how it goes.",train
Joey Tribbiani,It's Rachel.,train
Rachel Green,"You're going to have a baby, and you need to be prepared. Now, you're going to make yourself watch the whole thing. Just do it!",train
Rachel Green,Hmm...maybe it starts with how she gets pregnant.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"There's this woman, that I like. A lot. Well, it's complicated. She's with this other guy. For a long time. And I could never do that to the guy, y'know? 'Ccause we're really good friends.",train
Ross Geller,"So, uh, this guy, she used to go out with, is, uh... is he a good guy?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, he's the best.",train

Ross Geller,"It's not a big deal? Oh, I'm sorry I just...um, I...what about all the stuff you-you just said? I mean how about, I like-you-you can't stop thinking about her. Like how you can't sleep?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm an actor, y'know? As-as a group, we tend to be over dramatic.",train
Ross Geller,Rachel who's carrying my baby? Rachel?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Look no, I-I know it's bad, and I know it's wrong. Okay? But-but it's not like anything's ever gonna happen. Y'know? These-these are just feelings, they're gonna go away.",train
Ross Geller,Y'know what? I-I gotta go.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Oh come on Ross! Hey Ross-Ross don't...,train
Ross Geller,I just-y'know-I-I just have one-Rachel?!,train
Rachel Green,"Oh-oh! Okay, she's kicking!",train

Phoebe Buffay,Oh hey you guys!,train
Chandler Bing,Oh hey!,train
Rachel Green,Hi!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey listen let me ask you, do you believe in soul mates?",train
Rachel Green,Oh yes I do. I do. I believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone. And do you know how you find him? You stop looking for him. That's why I stopped looking for Russell Crowe. He'll find me.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh-huh, and you?",train
Chandler Bing,"No. I mean I believe that uh, certain people are more suited for each other and I believe in falling in love, but soul mates, I don't think they exist.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, good.",train
Chandler Bing,Why?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Well last night, I met Monica's.",train
Chandler Bing,What?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I had a date with this guy, and I swear to God, he is her other half.",train

Rachel Green,"Well, what's he like?!",train
Phoebe Buffay,Well he's tall.,train
Rachel Green,Uh-huh.,train
Phoebe Buffay,He has brown hair.,train
Rachel Green,"Of course, of course.",train

Rachel Green,Oh sure. Older?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Obviously, and he's British.",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, I was just gonna ask!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah? And, he's-he's so centered and mature and confident.",train
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's so sad they never had a chance to meet.",train
Chandler Bing,"Luckily, the guy she settled for can't hear what you're talking about.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'm so sorry. Um, and maybe I'm wrong! I but-y'know I'm gonna go out with him again, I'll find out more.",train
Chandler Bing,You believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you're still gonna date him?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, he may not be my soul mate, but a girl's gotta eat.",train
Monica Geller,Hey.,train
Ross Geller,Hey.,train
Monica Geller,"I just talked to Joey, I just-I want to see how you were.",train

Ross Geller,"Oh my God! What if, what if they get married? Then he'd be the stepfather of my child.",train
Monica Geller,"Honey, I don't think that's something we need to worry about! First of all he's-he's never gonna tell her how he feels about her. And even if he did you have no idea how she'd react.",train
Ross Geller,"Sure, because women never like Joey. Y'know, I think he's a virgin.",train
Monica Geller,Joey...he's not even thinking about going after Rachel!,train
Ross Geller,He's not?,train
Monica Geller,"No! All he's thinking about is how you're taking this! I mean, listen it's totally freaking him out. He's talking about moving to Vermont.",train
Ross Geller,Why?,train
Monica Geller,He says he wants to leave the country. He thinks you hate him.,train
Ross Geller,"Hate him? I... No, I don't hate him. It's just it's Rachel, y'know?",train
Monica Geller,"Honey I can't even imagine how hard this must be for you. But, I don't want you to lose Joey over it. And right now he just needs to know that you're still his friend.",train
Ross Geller,"Okay. Okay, I'll talk to him.",train
Monica Geller,"All right. Now do it soon, he just asked me how to convert his dollars into Vermont money.",train

Phoebe Buffay,Nothing! I swear to God I didn't know you guys would be here! And the good news is you didn't believe in soul mates. So...,train
Chandler Bing,"I believe in tall, handsome strangers who hit on my wife!",train
Phoebe Buffay,"They're just talking, and y'know what? Just because I think they're soul mates doesn't mean anything's gonna happen.",train

Joey Tribbiani,Bite me?,train
Ross Geller,"No, no I don't want to do anything to you. All right? I just want to tell you that I'm not mad at you and...and that I certainly do not hate you. I just, I just came here to say that.",train
Joey Tribbiani,Oh now-Hey Ross-Ross! Do you wanna-wanna come in for a beer or something?,train
Ross Geller,Uh...yeah sure.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Do uh, do you got any beer? All-all I got is this melon stuff that Rachel left. I don't...",train
Ross Geller,Okay.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey look Ross, you need to understand something okay? I uh...I am never gonna act on this Rachel thing, okay? I-I would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you.",train
Ross Geller,Thank you.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Anyway, it uh...look it'll just...take me a while to get over her, that's all. I'm not even sure how to do that, I mean I've never been in love before so...",train

Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I thought you knew that.",train
Ross Geller,"Umm, no.",train

Ross Geller,I think you need to tell her how you feel.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Okay that's the green stuff talkin'.,train
Ross Geller,"No, I'm serious. You-you need to find out where she is, because if she's not where you are, then you can start to move past this.",train
Joey Tribbiani,But what if uh-and I'm not saying she will be-But...,train
Ross Geller,If she is where you are then uh...then my feeling weird about it shouldn't stand in the way.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Are you sure?,train
Ross Geller,"Yeah. Look if-if she's gonna end up with somebody else, the truth is she couldn't find a better guy. So...",train
Joey Tribbiani,Hey thanks.,train
Ross Geller,So when do you think you're gonna talk to her?,train
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God I have to tell her! I haven't even thought about what I will say. What should I say?,train
Ross Geller,"I'm understanding, but let's not get carried away.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm sorry, you're right. What am I gonna say? Oh!",train
Ross Geller,"Yeah, tell me about it.",train
Chandler Bing,"Cheese you say? That's some pretty smelly work, huh Don?",train
Chandler Bing,"Cheese, it's smelly. You must smell a lot of the time too.",train
Monica Geller,"Me too! Yeah, Chandler can't stand it. He won't even allow me to have blue cheese in the house.",train
Monica Geller,"You know what I'd love to do? I would like to go to France and eat nothing but bread and cheese-Not even bread, just cheese. No, I want the bread. Yeah. Ah, and pastries... And pate. Oh, I'm really not high, it's just I used to be fat.",train

Chandler Bing,"Yeah, fine. Fine. Not perfect!! But good enough.",train
Monica Geller,Jeez! What is with you?,train
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry, did you say cheese?",train
Monica Geller,"All right, what's going on?",train
Chandler Bing,"Phoebe thinks you and Don are soul mates, and I don't believe in that kind of stuff. But then you two totally get along. So look, I won't stand in your way if you want to run off with Don and live in a house of cheese.",train
Monica Geller,"Chandler, you don't believe in soul mates?",train
Chandler Bing,No. But I'm sure 'tomatoes' does.,train
Monica Geller,I don't believe in soul mates either.,train
Chandler Bing,You don't?,train
Monica Geller,No. I don't think that you and I were destined to end up together. I think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship. Some days we work really hard.,train
Chandler Bing,So you...you don't want to live with Don in a cheese house?,train
Monica Geller,"No, I've had second thoughts about that. Do you realize how hard that would be to clean?",train
Chandler Bing,I love you.,train

Joey Tribbiani,"What? Yeah! Sure! Uh, look at the uh, the reason...-Is it hot in here?",train
Rachel Green,"No. Not-not for me, but why don't you take off your sweater?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"I would, but this is a nice place and my T-shirt has a picture of Calvin doing Hobbs.",train
Rachel Green,Oh my God! Really?! Can I see it?,train
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Sure.,train

Joey Tribbiani,But.,train
Rachel Green,Joey.,train

Monica Geller,What's up?,train
Rachel Green,"Well, I haven't seen him since that night that he told me how he y'know... I don't know, I think he's avoiding me. Why is that bagel on the floor?",train

Monica Geller,"Honey, you gotta talk to her.",train
Joey Tribbiani,I can't! Y'know? You guys don't know what it's like to put yourself out there like that and just get shot down.,train
Chandler Bing,"I don't know what that's like?! Up until I was 25 I thought the only response to, ""I love you,"" was, ""Oh crap!""",train
Monica Geller,"Hello? No rejection? I got shot down at fat camp! Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"All right so, so what do I do?",train

Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so when you're done with your tea I'll look at your leaves and tell you your fortune.",train
Chandler Bing,I didn't know you read tea leaves.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah, I've done it for years. I actually stopped because I was so accurate. Y'know, and-and y'know, one of the great joys of life is it's-it's wondrous unpredictability. Y'know? And also tea tends to give me the trots.",train
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'm done. Read mine.",train

Ross Geller,That's my favorite shirt! Okay? I love that shirt!,train
Rachel Green,Well just ask Mona to give it back!,train
Ross Geller,"I don't know. I mean I-I guess I could. It's just that we didn't really end things such good terms. And if I go over there I'd be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up, jump up my own ass and die.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh wait a second you guys...for the last couple weeks I've been that guy everywhere I go. We take the same bus. We go to the same bookstore, the same dry cleaners; maybe he's the tea guy.",train

Chandler Bing,"Wow, Ralph Lauren is really going out of there way to show they're not in the baby buying business.",train
Rachel Green,"Chandler, can you give us a minute?",train
Chandler Bing,"Oh I'm sorry, you're kicking me out of my own living room?",train

Joey Tribbiani,"Well I can promise you, at least one person will be crying. I'm an actor, and any actor worth himself can cry on cue.",train
Monica Geller,Really you can do that?,train
Joey Tribbiani,Are you kidding me? Watch! Well I can't do it with you guys watching me!,train
Chandler Bing,What are you doing?,train
Monica Geller,"Oh I'm working on my toast for the party, or as I like to call it. Sob fest 2002. Hey check this out.",train

Ross Geller,"No, us having to lie about being married.",train
Rachel Green,"No, I know I don't either, but ya know what, it's their party, and it's just one night. And we don't even have to lie; we just won't say anything. If it comes up again, we'll just...smile. We'll nod along.",train

Monica Geller,"It's just that, it's so much.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, so what I like him! Do I make fun of the people you've dated? Tag, Janice, Mona? No, because friends don't do that. But, do you want my opinion? Do you want it? 'Cause in my opinion, your collective dating record reads like the who's who of human crap.",train
Monica Geller,I feel terrible.,train
Joey Tribbiani,I know.,train
Ross Geller,What was wrong with Mona?,train
Rachel Green,Open it! Open it! Open it!,train
Ross Geller,Yeah baby!,train
Ross Geller,"No, no, it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends. It was a small wedding.",train

Rachel Green,So would I. You wouldn't think that Annie Liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera.,train

Rachel Green,Oh yeah. That's a great story.,train

Rachel Green,Shhh! I want to hear the rest!,train
Ross Geller,"Then, Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system, and the lights came down. And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words ""Will you marry me?""",train
Rachel Green,"And the ring, was the size of my fist !",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah uh, Phoebe! Look umm, I want to apologize about before, okay? We were being jerks. Parker's a nice guy and I'd like to get to know him.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Then you better do it now.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Why?,train
Phoebe Buffay,Because I'm going to kill him,train
Joey Tribbiani,What-what?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys were right. He's just too excited about...everything. I mean I'm all for living life, but this is the Geller's 35th anniversary. Okay? Let's call a spade a spade this party stinks.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"I know I'm having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, and when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!",train
Phoebe Buffay,Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"I guess it could've been, I didn't really look at it. Y'know, I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell out of there.",train
Phoebe Buffay,He's just such a great guy I'm so excited about him.,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh hey, you should be excited about him. There's nothing wrong with him he's a good guy.",train
Phoebe Buffay,You think?,train
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Ya know what I think; I think we were all just being too negative.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"You're right. You're right, he's just embracing life. We could all stand to be a little more like Parker. You know what? I am like him! I'm a sunny, positive person.",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.",train
Phoebe Buffay,What's that now?,train
Joey Tribbiani,Nothing...,train
Phoebe Buffay,Oh look it's Parker!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Oooh I love it!,train

Monica Geller,"Okay it's time for the toast! Umm now-now, I know that Ross usually gives the toast, but this year I'm going to do it.",train
Monica Geller,"No, no it's going to be great. Really! Mom, Dad, when I got married, one of the things that made me sure I could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me. For that and so many other things I want to say thank you. I know I probably don't say it enough, but I love you. When I look around this room, I'm-I'm saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us. Nana, my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here, but she can't because she's dead. As is our dog Chi-Chi. I mean look how cute she is. . Was. Do me a favor and pass this to my parents. Remember she's dead. Okay, her and Nana, gone. Wow! Hey does anybody remember when Debra Winger had to say goodbye to her children in Terms of Endearment? Didn't see that? No movie fans?! You want to hear something sad? The other day I was watching 60 Minutes these orphans in Romania, who have been so neglected, they were incapable of love. You people are made of stone! Here's to mom and dad! Whatever!",train
Ross Geller,"Oh, no, Mom, it's just Monica this year.",train
Ross Geller,"No, of course, Um... Um, everybody? Um, I-I just wanted to say...on behalf of my new bride, Rachel , and myself. Umm, that if...if in 35 years, we're half as happy as you guys are, we'll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Can I get you something to drink? Like a water and Valium?,train
Phoebe Buffay,Oh thank God.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah? I know! I know! Uh huh? Listen why don't we just um, sit and relax? You know just be with each other. Quietly!",train

Phoebe Buffay,"But, let's play this one first. And remember whoever talks first loses!",train
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! Oh my God!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Wrong? Really? You know the word wrong. Everything isn't perfect? Everything isn't magical? Everything isn't a glow with the light of a million fairies? They were just brake lights, Parker!",train
Phoebe Buffay,You don't have to put a good spin on everything.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"No! I am a positive person. You are like Santa Clause on Prozac, at Disneyland, getting laid!",train
Phoebe Buffay,Much less happy!,train
Phoebe Buffay,So long! Don't let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out!,train
Phoebe Buffay,Uh huh.,train
Ross Geller,"...and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!",train
Rachel Green,"Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.",train
Ross Geller,But having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?,train
Rachel Green,It was really fun being married to you tonight.,train
Ross Geller,"Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made.",train
Rachel Green,"Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?",train
Ross Geller,Yeah.,train
Rachel Green,"That proposal, at the planetarium...",train
Ross Geller,"I know, I know it was stupid.",train
Rachel Green,"Are you kidding?! With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars! It was...really wonderful! Did you just make that up?",train
Ross Geller,"No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out. It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me.",train
Rachel Green,"Well, that would've been very hard to say no too.",train
Ross Geller,"It's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding. Okay, good night.",train
Rachel Green,Goodnight.,train
Ross Geller,Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up?,train
Rachel Green,I will think about it.,train
Ross Geller,That's all I'm askin'.,train
Monica Geller,"Okay that's it. I give up. At mom and dad's 40th anniversary, you're the one giving the speech.",train
Ross Geller,Y'know I don't understand why they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.,train
Monica Geller,"Oh, come on.",train
Ross Geller,"Hey! All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad! And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin. And what you said about Nana. Ohh, yeah she really would've wanted to be there. And you know what? I think she was.",train
Monica Geller,"Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?",train

Joey Tribbiani,"No. They really like me over there. They want to do a big profile on me, but I said no.",train
Ross Geller,Why'd you say no?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Remember what happened the last time I did an interview for them? I said I write a lot of my own lines, and then the writers got mad and made my character fall down the elevator shaft. So who knows what I might say this time.",train
Chandler Bing,If only there was something in your head to control the things you say.,train
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on Joey! You will totally keep it in check this time, and plus y'know the publicity would be really good for your career! And you deserve that! And if you do the interview you can mention, oh I don't know, gal pal Rachel Green?",train
Chandler Bing,Is that gal pal spelled L-O-S-E-R?,train
Rachel Green,"Okay, don't listen to him. Please?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Fine! All right, I'll do it. But hey! You guys have to be at the next table so you can stop me if I y'know, start to say something stupid.",train

Joey Tribbiani,Well what's complicated? You spin the Wheel of Mayhem to go up the Ladder of Chance. You go past the Mud Hut through the Rainbow Ring to get to the Golden Monkey; you yank his tail and boom! You're in Paradise Pond!,train
Joey Tribbiani,Well what's fun about that? You expect me to be the host of a boring game that's just people standing around answering questions?,train

Rachel Green,Oh no? Pheebs? Monica? Do I know anything about babies?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"No, not a thing.",train
Monica Geller,It's frightening.,train

Ross Geller,Yeah.,train
Ross Geller,"That's a different issue. Uh, the point is, when the baby comes I will be there to...to feed her and bathe her and change her. And more than that I want to do all those things.",train
Ross Geller,"Yes! Yes, you're gonna be so missed.",train
Ross Geller,Well you're gonna be a wonderful grandma.,train
Rachel Green,Hello?! I still don't know what the hell I'm doing!,train
Ross Geller,"Oh, come on, every first time mother feels that way. You'll-you're gonna pick it up. Hey! You will! Uh look, y'know when you first came to the city? You were this spoiled helpless little girl who-who still used daddy's credit card. Do you remember?",train
Rachel Green,I hope you're going somewhere with this.,train
Ross Geller,Look at you! What-You're-you're this big executive! You are much more capable than you give yourself credit for. I-I have no doubt you're gonna be an incredible mother.,train

Ross Geller,I'm telling you.,train
Rachel Green,Thank you.,train
Ross Geller,Oh.,train
Monica Geller,You're still so funny. You're so funny. What do I do?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Nothing! You have apologized to her like a million times and she's been nothing but terrible to you. And don't forget you just threw her daughter a lovely, albeit slightly boring, shower, and she hasn't even thanked you for it.",train
Monica Geller,Y'know what? You're-you're right.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah I mean if you want to say anything to her, I'd tell her off.",train
Monica Geller,Really?,train
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh!,train
Monica Geller,"Okay! I will! Mrs. Green? Mrs. Green! It is rude to leave a party without saying good-bye to the host! Yeah, and-and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it! Now what I did to you, it wasn't on purpose! But what you're during to me now is just plain spiteful!",train
Monica Geller,That's right! Maybe it's time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady...old lady...lady!,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up...",train
Monica Geller,"So whenever you're ready to apologize to me, I will forgive you. Good day! I can't feel my legs!",train
Phoebe Buffay,You were fantastic! I'm so proud of you!,train
Monica Geller,Yeah? I'm proud of me too.,train
Phoebe Buffay,You should be!,train

Rachel Green,"Uh, put your elbow in it.",train
Ross Geller,Excellent! How do you put a baby down for a nap?,train
Rachel Green,"Full, dry, on its back, and no loose covers.",train
Ross Geller,"That's correct! This is an audio question, what do you do when the baby makes this sound?",train
Rachel Green,"Check if it's wet, check if it's hungry, burp it!",train
Ross Geller,"Excellent! Excellent, now-now do you want another question or a Wicked Wango card?",train
Rachel Green,A card! A card! I pick a card!,train
Ross Geller,"Oh, I'm sorry you've been Bamboozled! You're gonna be a terrible mother! I've lost sight of why we're doing this!",train
Ross Geller,Hey you guys I got some bad news.,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Well that's no way to sell newspapers. Why don't you try, ""Extra! Extra! Read all about it!""",train

Monica Geller,Is he right? Am I really-Am I awful?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Yeah Monica! You listen to me, okay? And I'm not just saying this because I'm your friend, I'm sayin' it 'cause it's the truth. You're food is abysmal!",train

Chandler Bing,I have a job interview I have to get ready for.,train
Joey Tribbiani,I thought you already have a job.,train

Joey Tribbiani,Wow! How do you know how to do that?!,train
Chandler Bing,That's what I do now.,train
Monica Geller,"Hey Joey, come taste this.",train

Ross Geller,"Oh, okay.",train
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah! Actually, that's one of the reasons why we're not a couple.",train

Monica Geller,"Hi! Umm, I'm Monica Geller, I'm the chef at Alessandro's.",train

Monica Geller,"I-I-I'm sorry, your-your mouth was full, I didn't hear what you said. Umm, hats off to who now?",train
Monica Geller,That's right.,train
Chandler Bing,"...I think you'll find if I come to work here, I don't micro-manage. I don't shy away from delegating.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"Um-hmm, that's good to know. But let's stop focusing on what you don't do, and start focusing on what you do do.",train
Chandler Bing,"What I do do...is manage to uh, create an atmosphere of support for the people working with me.",train

Rachel Green,Well I-That's never gonna happen with Ross.,train
Rachel Green,Really?,train
Rachel Green,"Well... That's...y'know-That's-We've been alone for the last twenty minutes we're doing okay. Besides y'know what? I-I-Maybe we won't be alone, 'cause lately I-I-things have been happening between me and Ross, y'know? Right before I went into labor, we-we had this kiss. Y'know? So it might be the...the beginning of something.",train
Ross Geller,Hey Janice!,train
Ross Geller,Who's this little guy?,train
Ross Geller,No-no. No.,train

Rachel Green,Right.,train
Ross Geller,I mean we don't want to go down that road do we?,train

Ross Geller,"Oh what are you kidding? She's gorgeous, it's all Rachel.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again? No, I know. I know, because you're not in that place. Which would be fine, except you totally are.",train
Ross Geller,It's...it's complicated okay?,train
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah that's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer.",train
Ross Geller,"Look, we've been together. Okay? And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby. It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work out...I could never do that to Emma. I mean she-she thinking everything- Oh that's...now me. What do they put something in the water in this place? Since Rachel and I we're doing really, we're doing really well right now.",train
Phoebe Buffay,"I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it.",train
Ross Geller,"Yeah, exactly.",train
Phoebe Buffay,Right. Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were fifteen.,train
Joey Tribbiani,Hey. I just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time; it is like a freak show up here. What's the matter?,train
Rachel Green,Nothing.,train
Joey Tribbiani,What is it? Hey!,train
Rachel Green,Really it's nothing. I'm just...,train

Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, how long was I watching that woman?",train
Rachel Green,"I'm just saying that y'know, someday Ross is gonna meet somebody and...he's gonna have his own life. Right?",train
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I guess so.",train
Rachel Green,I just never thought I would raise this baby all by myself. Pretty dumb huh?,train
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, listen to me, listen to me...you are never ever gonna be alone. Okay? I promise that's not gonna happen.",train
Rachel Green,Joey. Honey what would I do without you?,train
Joey Tribbiani,You don't have to worry about that okay?,train

Rachel Green,"Uh yeah, actually I kinda need to talk to you too.",val
Ross Geller,"Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?",val
Joey Tribbiani,No.,val
Ross Geller,What?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I'm sorry. I meant no.",val
Monica Geller,Hi! Hey look who's here!,val
Chandler Bing,He pulled a quarter out of my ear!,val
Ross Geller,"Hey, where's uh, where's mom?",val
Monica Geller,"Oh, Aunt Liddy's coming? That means we get five dollars each!",val
Chandler Bing,Okay. Wow.,val
Ross Geller,"Uh Dad, Emma's in the nursery. I'll take you now. If you want, but I really want to talk to you.",val
Rachel Green,"I know, I still need to talk to you.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh hey but, before you guys do that I need to talk to you, and Ross, I need to talk to you.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh and I need to talk to you.,val
Monica Geller,About what?,val
Phoebe Buffay,To see if know what these guys are talking about.,val
Monica Geller,Isn't she beautiful?,val
Ross Geller,What about Ben?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?",val
Ross Geller,"Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yay! It's so exciting! Wow, you could've done that with us there.",val
Ross Geller,Yeah right.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you can't talk to Rachel.",val
Ross Geller,What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?",val
Chandler Bing,Sure.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Dude I just did something terrible.,val
Chandler Bing,That was you?! I thought it was Jack!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!",val
Chandler Bing,What?! Why does she think that?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Because it kinda looked like I did.,val
Chandler Bing,"Again, what?!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my hand.",val
Chandler Bing,As we all are at some point during the day.,val
Joey Tribbiani,It wasn't my ring! It fell out of Ross's jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!,val
Chandler Bing,Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?,val
Joey Tribbiani,I guess.,val
Chandler Bing,And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!,val
Joey Tribbiani,I know! I know it's awful.,val
Chandler Bing,"Well, what did she say?",val
Joey Tribbiani,She said yes.,val
Chandler Bing,Does Ross know?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?",val
Chandler Bing,Well maybe you don't have to tell him anything.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I like that. Yeah.",val
Chandler Bing,"If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Now let's not get carried away.,val
Monica Geller,I want a baby.,val
Chandler Bing,"Honey, we've been over this. I need to be facing the other way.",val
Monica Geller,"Come on! Come on, if we have sex again it'll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closet's still available?",val
Chandler Bing,"I'm so tired. Yeah okay, but no foreplay.",val
Monica Geller,Deal!,val
Ross Geller,Dad seriously! Y'know you really should see someone about that!,val
Ross Geller,"I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?",val
Ross Geller,Actually umm...,val
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,val
Rachel Green,Hi.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Are you all right?,val
Rachel Green,Uhh... I think I just got engaged.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! He did it?,val
Rachel Green,Well...did you know he was gonna ask me?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Are you kidding? I'm like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.,val
Rachel Green,And you really think this is a good idea?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"I just talked him into it, don't tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.",val
Rachel Green,I just don't know! It just doesn't feel right.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.",val
Rachel Green,Really?! Even Ross?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Especially Ross!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh y'know what? I'll-I'll come back later.",val
Ross Geller,"Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. I'll guess just...I'll come back.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"There he goes, your fiance.",val
Rachel Green,I guess so.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Although he does play with himself in his sleep.,val
Rachel Green,I can't say that I'm surprised.,val
Ross Geller,"Dad, what are you doing?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"It can't be me, I'm standing right here.",val
Ross Geller,No!,val
Ross Geller,Y'know what? I don't like you without mom. Come on.,val
Joey Tribbiani,We're not peeking?,val
Chandler Bing,"Hello sir, you know Monica.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey uh, is it okay to come in?",val
Rachel Green,"Of course! Oh Joey, this ring I...it's beautiful I love it!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah uh look Rach, there's something I gotta tell ya.",val
Rachel Green,Hey!,val
Rachel Green,"Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she won't take my breast?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Yowsa!,val
Rachel Green,"Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Dear Lord.,val
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry honey, what were you saying?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh uh-uh yeah, I think that.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh look, she's pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? She looks scared. Doesn't she look scared?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know, I don't really know her.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Are you kidding me?!,val
Rachel Green,It's just so frustrating! Why doesn't she want my breast?!,val
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know! Maybe she's crazy!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh hey! Wait up!,val
Ross Geller,Hi!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Congratulations! I didn't want to say anything in front of Joey 'cause I didn't know if he knew yet.,val
Ross Geller,"What, that we had a baby? Come on let's give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!",val
Ross Geller,What?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We haven't done the secret thing in a long time.",val
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didn't propose.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?,val
Ross Geller,I am a doctor! Y'know what? I'm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, me too. Should we wake her up?",val
Ross Geller,"No! No, come on let her sleep! She's so exhausted.",val
Phoebe Buffay,And so engaged.,val
Ross Geller,What? Oh my God! She-she thinks we're engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think we're engaged?!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Y'know Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.,val
Ross Geller,I didn't give her that ring!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Really?,val
Ross Geller,No!,val
Phoebe Buffay,So whose ring is it?,val
Ross Geller,It's mine.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Is it an engagement ring?,val
Ross Geller,Yes!,val
Phoebe Buffay,But you didn't give it to her?,val
Ross Geller,No!,val
Phoebe Buffay,But you were going to propose?,val
Ross Geller,No!!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Huh, I might be losing interest in this.",val
Ross Geller,"Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybe...kinda...wanted ah...start...things up again.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.",val
Ross Geller,"Look, I didn't want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didn't want to either. But I don't, I don't understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.",val
Ross Geller,Well I didn't! I didn't propose! Unless uh... Did I? I haven't slept in forty hours and...it does sound like something I would do.,val
Chandler Bing,"Look, we can't stay in here forever.",val
Monica Geller,"Oh, I still can't believe my dad saw us having sex! He didn't make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!",val
Chandler Bing,"This is okay. We're all adults here; there's nothing to be ashamed of. Now, let's put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door.",val
Monica Geller,Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?,val
Chandler Bing,"I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.",val
Monica Geller,It wasn't fun?!,val
Chandler Bing,"Why? Why-why-would you-Wh-why... Look, I just don't want you to think that we're animals who do it whenever we want.",val
Monica Geller,"The truth is, Dad, we're-we're trying.",val
Monica Geller,"Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.",val
Monica Geller,"Well, that's okay dad, we-we can wait until later.",val
Monica Geller,Daddy?!,val
Chandler Bing,"That's funny, this conversation's how I got the bullet hole in my head.",val
Monica Geller,Daddy! I don't think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.,val
Monica Geller,I don't feel good right now.,val
Chandler Bing,"Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.",val
Monica Geller,Hey.,val
Rachel Green,Hey. I need to tell you something.,val
Monica Geller,"Well, now's a good time. I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.",val
Rachel Green,Joey asked me marry him.,val
Monica Geller,What?,val
Rachel Green,Joey proposed to me.,val
Monica Geller,Is he crazy?! You just had Ross's baby!,val
Rachel Green,"Well, I-I said yes.",val
Monica Geller,"What?! Are you crazy? You just had Ross's baby! It's-it's so inappropriate. No, it's worse than that. It's wrong. It's... It is bigger than mine!",val
Rachel Green,"I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.",val
Monica Geller,You can't marry him!,val
Rachel Green,Why not? I don't want to do this alone! And he's such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.,val
Monica Geller,Well do you love him?,val
Rachel Green,Sure.,val
Monica Geller,Sure?,val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I mean whatever.",val
Monica Geller,"Honey, the question is...do you really want to marry Joey?",val
Rachel Green,"No. No, I don't. Could you be a dear and go tell him?",val
Chandler Bing,You still haven't told Rachel you weren't really proposing?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.",val
Chandler Bing,"Joey, you have to tell her what's going on! And what did it look like?!",val
Joey Tribbiani,I didn't look at it. Stupid baby's head was blocking most of it.,val
Chandler Bing,Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, it's not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I don't want to hurt her.",val
Chandler Bing,"Okay, look, just do it gently.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"You're right. You're right. I-I'll go tell her now before Ross finds out and I'll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there if you want to check that out.",val
Ross Geller,Hey.,val
Rachel Green,Hey.,val
Ross Geller,"Listen, I um... I heard about the engagement.",val
Rachel Green,Surprised?,val
Ross Geller,"And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I um...I didn't propose to you.",val
Rachel Green,I know.,val
Ross Geller,I don't think you do.,val
Rachel Green,You didn't propose to me. Joey did.,val
Ross Geller,"Poor baby, you're so tired. Rach, I didn't propose to you, Joey didn't propose to you, and Chandler didn't propose to you.",val
Rachel Green,"Uh... You didn't propose to me, Chandler didn't propose to me, but Joey did.",val
Ross Geller,Joey proposed to you?,val
Joey Tribbiani,I can come back.,val
Ross Geller,"Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?",val
Joey Tribbiani,No.,val
Rachel Green,Yes you did!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Actually, technically, I didn't.",val
Rachel Green,Well then why did you give me a ring?,val
Ross Geller,"Wait! Whoa-whoa, you...you gave her the ring?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!",val
Rachel Green,"Yes, you did!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I didn't!",val
Rachel Green,"Yes, you did!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I didn't!",val
Rachel Green,"Yes, you did! And don't you say, ""No, I didn't!""",val
Joey Tribbiani,Ahhh!,val
Rachel Green,He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.,val
Ross Geller,Whoa! You were down on one knee?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didn't...I didn't propose!",val
Ross Geller,Then what did happen?,val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, what did happen?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.",val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, but you said, ""Will you marry me?""",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I didn't!",val
Rachel Green,"Yes, you did!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I didn't!",val
Rachel Green,"Yes, you did-Oh my God you didn't! Well then why didn't you tell me that before?!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!",val
Ross Geller,"Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!",val
Joey Tribbiani,I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.,val
Rachel Green,"Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"It wasn't my ring! It's Ross's ring! That's why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.",val
Ross Geller,What?!,val
Rachel Green,You were gonna propose to me?,val
Ross Geller,Uhh... No.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, this is awkward.",val
Ross Geller,"But I-I was going to see if y'know, maybe you uh, start dating again but that-I mean that-that was all, Rach.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, step up! I proposed.",val
Ross Geller,"No, you didn't!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh that's right. There's a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.,val
Rachel Green,Okay.,val
Ross Geller,I can't believe you told her I was going to propose!,val
Joey Tribbiani,I can't believe you're not going to propose!,val
Ross Geller,"Hey, I'm not going to rush into anything!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!",val
Rachel Green,Oh my God!,val
Ross Geller,What?,val
Rachel Green,"She's doing it Look, she's breast-feeding look!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, it's beautiful.",val
Rachel Green,Okay.,val
Ross Geller,Thank you.,val
Rachel Green,"Oh wow, this feels weird.",val

Rachel Green,Wonderful weird.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Y'know what you guys? I'm uh, I'm gonna go too. And uh, I'm sorry about everything.",val
Rachel Green,"Honey don't worry, it was my mistake.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, Rach, I should've told you sooner. It's just that...Man! That kid is going to town!",val
Rachel Green,She's perfect.,val
Ross Geller,We're so lucky.,val
Rachel Green,We really are.,val
Ross Geller,"Look, I-I know it's not a proposal and I don't know where you are, but with everything that's been going on and with Emma and...I've been feeling.",val
Rachel Green,I know. I know. I've feeling.,val
Ross Geller,Yeah?,val
Rachel Green,Yeah.,val
Ross Geller,"Okay, well, that... Wow, okay, well, umm...then maybe, at least we can, we can talk about us again.",val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, maybe.",val
Ross Geller,"Well good, okay. I-I, kind of think y'know if we...if You're wearing the ring.",val
Rachel Green,Wh-what's that?,val
Ross Geller,And you told Phoebe you were engaged.,val
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, what?",val
Ross Geller,When you thought Joey proposed did...did you say yes?,val
Monica Geller,Hey dad!,val
Chandler Bing,Hey.,val
Ross Geller,You said you'd marry Joey?,val
Rachel Green,"Okay you have to realize, I was exhausted, I was emotional, I would have said yes to anybody. Like that time you and I got married! I'm not helping.",val
Ross Geller,"So you said yes to him, and you just had our baby?",val
Rachel Green,That is right and traditionally the daddy is supposed to give the mummy a present but I am prepared to let that go.,val
Ross Geller,"So when I came in here to see if you wanted to maybe start things up again, you were engaged to my best friend.",val
Rachel Green,Well-Really? I thought Chandler was your best friend.,val
Ross Geller,"Well, Chandler's my oldest friend, but Joey's my-No! Ah!",val
Rachel Green,Ooooo!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey you guys I'm gonna take off. I just wanted to let you guys know, say goodbye.",val
Ross Geller,Rachel said she'd marry you?!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"This isn't the right room, sorry folks.",val
Monica Geller,"Ok, I don't wanna be negative so I'll say that most of the signs you bought are good.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"No they ran out of ""It's a girl"" but I can fix this one, See?",val
Monica Geller,So sexy. Honey.,val
Chandler Bing,Yea yea.,val
Monica Geller,Honey why don't you go lie down.,val

Ross Geller,"Okay let's put aside that you ""accidentally"" picked up my grandmothers ring and you ""accidentally"" proposed to Rachel.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this I don't really know what that means. You were saying?",val

Ross Geller,"You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms.",val

Joey Tribbiani,So?,val
Ross Geller,So I don't wanna be just anybody.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Wow.,val
Ross Geller,"You know what, it's, it's better this way anyway. I mean I don't know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. It's just much easier if we're just friends who have a kid.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Really?,val
Ross Geller,Yeah.,val
Joey Tribbiani,And you're Okay with that?,val
Ross Geller,"Yes. I mean, it's what we always planned. And if you have a plan, you should stick to it. That's why they call them plans. Hello? I'm fine.",val

Phoebe Buffay,Look at you all grown up.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.",val

Joey Tribbiani,Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said... There's no guy in there!,val
Rachel Green,"It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?",val
Monica Geller,Excuse me?,val
Chandler Bing,I know what she's talking about.,val
Rachel Green,"We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.",val
Monica Geller,Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?,val
Rachel Green,Ross said he died.,val
Monica Geller,"He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.",val
Monica Geller,"Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.",val
Chandler Bing,He saw a therapist?,val
Monica Geller,"Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.",val
Rachel Green,Why? What was it?,val
Monica Geller,That I was going to eat him.,val
Joey Tribbiani,MIKE!!!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Okay!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Atta boy!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, look...",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?",val
Joey Tribbiani,From school.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Mike, 'attorney at law'!",val
Joey Tribbiani,What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...",val
Joey Tribbiani,Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.",val
Monica Geller,Hey!,val
Chandler Bing,Hey!,val
Monica Geller,What are you doing?,val
Chandler Bing,Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.,val
Monica Geller,That's so sweet. Find anything?,val
Chandler Bing,Slim Pickings.,val
Monica Geller,"Nothing, huh?",val
Chandler Bing,"No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.",val
Monica Geller,'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.,val
Chandler Bing,'So Cheesy' also has an opening.,val
Monica Geller,"Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.",val
Chandler Bing,Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.,val
Monica Geller,"Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo 'I'll take it!'",val
Rachel Green,"Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.",val
Ross Geller,Thanks doctor.,val
Ross Geller,You even have to ask?! He is alive!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great! Mary Ellen Wait, is your mom okay?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Please, we're trying to have a conversation.",val
Phoebe Buffay,What?!,val
Joey Tribbiani,What?!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Do you not know each other?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games. Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?",val
Joey Tribbiani,What are you doing? I said seven! Argh!!!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Who are you kidding? You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. Mike!! Mike!!",val
Phoebe Buffay,I'm out of here.,val
Joey Tribbiani,You're leaving too?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Good night!,val
Chandler Bing,"Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.",val
Monica Geller,You're right. Maybe I shouldn't go.,val
Chandler Bing,What?,val
Monica Geller,"So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo . It's just a little outside of Tulsa.",val
Chandler Bing,How far outside?,val
Monica Geller,Manhattan.,val
Chandler Bing,"And you're thinking of taking it? So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, me, new job.",val

Ross Geller,"Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay?",val
Rachel Green,"Ah, did I leave the stove on?",val

Ross Geller,"Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think you're right. I think ... listen, listen!",val
Rachel Green,Ubb.,val
Ross Geller,"A pigeon, a pigeon. No, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird's aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.",val
Rachel Green,"Boy, are you gonna be sorry if that's true.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe we should just eat now.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But there's still some food left on their place, okay, what's the restaurant's policy about people eatin' that?",val
Joey Tribbiani,But it happens? I'm gotta go to the bathroom.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"No, you can't go. No-no-no, I can't hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I cave.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"If you ask me to stay, I'll pee.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, fine, I'll move. Alright, you don't have to manhandle me. Where? Okay. Thank you. Wach.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Finally you guys made it. Pheebs, who the hell-uhuhh!",val
Monica Geller,Spend more time with the tie. That'll make a baby.,val
Chandler Bing,"Look, I can't do this. I can't make luv to you while we're fighting this way.",val
Monica Geller,"Oh sure, now you're Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle's funeral.",val
Chandler Bing,"That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, I'm not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?",val
Monica Geller,"No, you're right. Mnya, we shouldn't do it like this. Huch. For what it's worth, I'm, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.",val
Chandler Bing,Mean it?,val
Monica Geller,Yah.,val
Chandler Bing,"You are incredible. Unless, I...I'm not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you.",val
Monica Geller,D'you want to?,val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, let's celebrate life!",val
Monica Geller,'kay.,val
Rachel Green,"Och, god. Oh, thank god, you're okay. I'm so sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. Uch.",val
Ross Geller,Great. So let's get going?,val
Rachel Green,"Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, I'm never leaving her again.",val
Ross Geller,Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.,val
Chandler Bing,Uhh. You are welcome.,val
Monica Geller,You know what? Let's not talk.,val
Chandler Bing,What?,val
Monica Geller,Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.,val
Chandler Bing,But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettes-no big deal.,val
Monica Geller,"Oh, blablablabaybaybay.",val
Chandler Bing,Leave it.,val
Monica Geller,I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldn't have sex with me while we're fighting.,val
Chandler Bing,You tricked me to get me into bed?,val
Monica Geller,"That's right, I got mine.",val
Chandler Bing,I feel so used.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I guess they're not coming. You wanna just order?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Thank you. Waiter! 'lright, this is gonna be fast, so try to keep up: Risotto with the shaped truffles and the roasted rip steak with the golden Chanterelles and a Bordelaise sauce and that any that stuff I just said means snails.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Both it is, thank you.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request: Can you bring everything as soon as it's ready? Appetizers, entrees, we don't care.",val
Phoebe Buffay,You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?,val
Ross Geller,I'm so sorry ...,val
Rachel Green,"We got locked out of the apartment, we ...",val
Joey Tribbiani,That's a great story-can I eat it?,val
Ross Geller,And then Rachel wasn't sure she could leave the baby.,val
Rachel Green,"N-it wasn't easy, but it's your birthday and I did what I got to do.",val
Phoebe Buffay,And that's Judy over there at the bar with Emma?,val
Rachel Green,"Oh honey, this is for the best, thus I'm not distracted, worrying about Emma, how she's doing at home and I'm being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!",val
Ross Geller,What?,val
Rachel Green,"She spit up. Judy! She spi...Judy! Look alive, Judy! Thank you.",val
Ross Geller,Thanks. Oh.,val
Rachel Green,"Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.,val
Ross Geller,Y'know this ??? is incredible.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.,val
Ross Geller,"Okay, I'll have the fixed salad and the duck.",val
Rachel Green,"Yah, I'll have the soup and the salmon.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because ...",val
Monica Geller,Happy birthday!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Son of a bitch!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Wher-where have you been?,val
Monica Geller,"Well, we had a little fight.",val
Chandler Bing,I would never lie to get someone into bed.,val
Monica Geller,"You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isn't it? How d'you get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.",val
Chandler Bing,I suppose that Monica will have the ... manipulative shrew.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew!",val
Ross Geller,"Rach, c'mon, Emma is fine. You're turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.",val
Rachel Green,Y'guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?,val
Chandler Bing,You mean the lully story?,val
Ross Geller,"Huh-huh, they already know it.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"You guys, we've been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, it's okay, I already told the waiter what they want.",val
Monica Geller,Why would you do that?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Chandler, control your woman!",val
Rachel Green,"Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast ... to Phoebe. She dropped her sock.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Aw ... what?,val
Rachel Green,"N-no, Emma dropped her sock.",val
Monica Geller,"Mom's here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.",val
Rachel Green,"Ross, she still has not noticed that the baby's sock is on the ground.",val
Phoebe Buffay,'s a good toast.,val
Rachel Green,Could you please get her attention?,val
Ross Geller,W-oa ... Mommy!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, for god's sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! I'm sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt the hideousness that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didn't even have the courtesy to call. Well, it's too late now.",val
Ross Geller,"Well, ??? think that's us?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"well, this is, this is, this is not over! Hello?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, what is going on with you two?",val
Monica Geller,"Uch, you see, I'm ovulating.",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, that's what she says. But maybe you're not ovulating at all, maybe it's just a clever ruse to get me into bed.",val
Monica Geller,"Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just can't get enough.",val
Chandler Bing,You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"So? Did have sex, right?",val
Chandler Bing,What's the matter with me? Why I'm such a girl?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, that was Mike.",val
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, hi, we're so sorry. You're totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, I'm gonna take off.",val
Rachel Green,What?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, I'm not t-not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! Judy! Bye.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh thank god, if Phoebe's going, can we please take Emma home?",val
Ross Geller,"You know, I think that's a good idea-our babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnet. Bye, y'guys.",val
Monica Geller,Bye.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"See ya. Well, this is just us.",val
Monica Geller,"So, I'm, I'm probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?",val
Chandler Bing,"So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Do, do you gonna do it now?",val
Monica Geller,We don't have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct ...,val
Joey Tribbiani,No-ohoh.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Nah, just me. All alone. Dinner for six for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Joey! Joey.,val
Joey Tribbiani,That's the best birthday ever.,val
Chandler Bing,Hello? Hello?,val
Monica Geller,I LOVE MY NEW JOB!,val
Chandler Bing,"Honey, you're screaming.",val
Monica Geller,YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that's great.",val
Monica Geller,"Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.",val
Chandler Bing,Awesome.,val
Monica Geller,"Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met.",val
Phoebe Buffay,I know!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I kinda do. Well, how's this?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? Have you not talked about it yet? Am I making you uncomfortable? If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh.",val
Phoebe Buffay,I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Maybe not, is it?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, I want to.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go.",val
Phoebe Buffay,It really is.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh!",val
Rachel Green,"So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.",val
Rachel Green,"That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?",val
Rachel Green,Allright. Well thank you so much for coming...,val
Ross Geller,Thank you.,val
Rachel Green,Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.,val
Ross Geller,"Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.",val
Rachel Green,Okidoki! Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.,val
Ross Geller,"Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.",val
Rachel Green,"What, the blonde with no bra?",val
Ross Geller,"She was blonde? Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.",val
Rachel Green,Okay...,val
Ross Geller,And she's a little mannish...,val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! David!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Who cares, it got you here.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Wow. Where is your luggage?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good.",val
Phoebe Buffay,No...,val
Phoebe Buffay,I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?,val
Monica Geller,Maybe he didn't give you a chance.,val
Phoebe Buffay,He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...,val
Monica Geller,"Oh, well... That had been your window.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible.",val
Monica Geller,Really? The scientist guy?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Really? Chandler?,val
Monica Geller,Continue...,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.",val
Monica Geller,Phoebe!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"I know! Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!",val
Monica Geller,"Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.",val
Monica Geller,What are you gonna do?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...",val
Monica Geller,You have to tell David!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.",val
Chandler Bing,"Funniest guy she's ever met! I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... Save it for inside!",val
Monica Geller,Heeeeeey!,val
Chandler Bing,Hey!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,val
Chandler Bing,"So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.",val
Monica Geller,Was your cabin pressurised?,val
Chandler Bing,And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.,val
Chandler Bing,"What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?",val
Monica Geller,"No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?",val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, he came up...",val
Monica Geller,"Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken.",val
Chandler Bing,Were you there?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...",val
Rachel Green,"Sandy, that's exactly what it is...",val
Ross Geller,Are you gay?,val
Rachel Green,Ross!,val
Rachel Green,Oh!,val
Rachel Green,"Oh, that's pretty.",val
Ross Geller,So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?,val
Ross Geller,Okay.,val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, that would be great! I love him, I love him, I love him...",val
Ross Geller,"Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!",val
Rachel Green,"So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.",val
Ross Geller,"Because, it's weird!",val
Rachel Green,Why?,val
Ross Geller,What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...,val
Rachel Green,Yes?,val
Ross Geller,King?,val
Rachel Green,Please? YES! Sandy you're hired.,val
Rachel Green,Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.,val
Ross Geller,You gotta be at least bi...,val
Chandler Bing,"Hey! I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.,val
Chandler Bing,"Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, right? Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?",val
Chandler Bing,Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Seriously? She actually said that?,val
Chandler Bing,Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!,val
Chandler Bing,Yeah!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Without that, you just got ""lame with women"".",val
Chandler Bing,Ye....,val
Monica Geller,Hi! There you are.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Fire trucks!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Oof...,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, wait, wait!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, it's not that. Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I should have told you.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.",val
Phoebe Buffay,I am happy.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Of course, yeah. You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...",val
Phoebe Buffay,I mean...,val
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... In New York... it's...",val
Rachel Green,Oh... Oh boy... Hi...,val
Ross Geller,Is everything allright?,val
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiance and it was just sooo beautiful.",val
Rachel Green,I can't... I can't hear it again.,val
Ross Geller,"And I'm fine never having heard it... Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?",val
Rachel Green,Yeah! Excuse me...,val
Ross Geller,Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.,val
Rachel Green,"Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.",val
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive.",val
Rachel Green,What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?,val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I mean, all things that guy... These are amazing!",val
Rachel Green,Sandy made Madeleines.,val
Ross Geller,"This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks.",val
Rachel Green,"Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.",val
Ross Geller,Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.,val
Rachel Green,"Okay, what? What is too sensitive?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no. No.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...",val
Phoebe Buffay,And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.,val
Ross Geller,Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?,val
Monica Geller,Yeah! I think that's great!,val
Ross Geller,"Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?",val
Monica Geller,Oh... How are they?,val
Ross Geller,Lighter than air... But that's not the point.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,val
Ross Geller,Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...,val
Ross Geller,Thank you!,val
Joey Tribbiani,That's like a woman wanting to be a...,val
Ross Geller,...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?,val
Monica Geller,Yes... What is the end of that sentence?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Uhm... A penis model. Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?",val
Monica Geller,"Yeah, so?",val
Ross Geller,Wow!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Really? Do you not know Chandler?,val
Monica Geller,"Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...",val
Joey Tribbiani,"So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is...",val
Ross Geller,Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?,val
Joey Tribbiani,...No...,val
Monica Geller,I can't believe he's that upset about this...,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like...",val
Chandler Bing,Hey!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Heeeyy! Hey!,val
Chandler Bing,What are you guys talking about?,val
Ross Geller,Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny.,val
Chandler Bing,You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...?,val
Chandler Bing,"You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse.",val
Monica Geller,"Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!",val
Chandler Bing,"If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza.",val
Monica Geller,"Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it!",val
Chandler Bing,What is so funny about that?,val
Monica Geller,"Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy!",val
Chandler Bing,Did you tell her what we talked about?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah....,val
Chandler Bing,So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS?,val
Monica Geller,"Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.",val
Chandler Bing,Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?,val
Monica Geller,"Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...",val
Chandler Bing,"I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.",val
Monica Geller,"Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? That slayed me.",val
Ross Geller,Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Not knowing when to shut up...,val
Ross Geller,Yep! That's my thing...,val
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no...",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, well, yeah...",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! Here David, you should just go.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, well... guys?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Right! Never! Never! I swear!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns.",val
Ross Geller,Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this...,val
Ross Geller,I swear to God...!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Me! I'm up for puppets!,val
Ross Geller,"Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?",val
Joey Tribbiani,I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch.,val
Ross Geller,Oh my God!,val
Rachel Green,That was kind of rude!,val
Ross Geller,"Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.",val
Rachel Green,"You know, he was just doing his job...",val
Ross Geller,"Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, come on Ross...",val
Ross Geller,"No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...",val
Rachel Green,Oh... That's true.,val
Ross Geller,Thank you!,val
Rachel Green,"Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it.",val
Joey Tribbiani,I am learning so much from you.,val
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.",val
Monica Geller,"Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.",val
Chandler Bing,"Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!",val
Monica Geller,"Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.",val
Chandler Bing,I love you too. And... I like you as a friend.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Allright. See you later!,val
Chandler Bing,See ya!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Did that guy really make that joke?,val
Monica Geller,"Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.",val
Ross Geller,Here goes...,val
Rachel Green,I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.,val
Ross Geller,"Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out.",val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...",val
Rachel Green,YOU! You feel!,val
Ross Geller,I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...,val
Rachel Green,"Oh, damn you Geller!",val
Ross Geller,"Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.",val
Ross Geller,"No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue.",val
Ross Geller,"You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.",val
Ross Geller,Why... I... I don't know. Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?,val
Ross Geller,"I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.",val
Rachel Green,Huh ha ha!,val
Ross Geller,"I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.",val
Ross Geller,"It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... ""What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?",val
Ross Geller,"I know I am! ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?",val
Ross Geller,Here come some more...,val
Joey Tribbiani,What kind?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Wow! You blow my mind...,val
Joey Tribbiani,Aaahh... How much do I owe you?,val
Joey Tribbiani,It's like the cheapest college ever.,val
Ross Geller,"And that's why, no matter what mommy says, we really were on a break. Yes we were! Yes we were! Come here gorgeous. Oh! Look at you! You are the cutest little baby ever! You're just a... a little bitty baby, you know that? But you've got... You've got big beautiful eyes... Yes you do... and a... and a big round belly. Big baby butt! I like big butts. I like big butts and I cannot lie / you other brothers can't deny / when a girl walks in with an itty, bitty, waist / and a round thing in your face you get... Oh my God, Emma... you're laughing! Oh my God, you've never done that before, have you? You never done that before... Daddy made you laugh, huh? Well, daddy and Sir Mix Alot... What? What? You... you wanna hear some more? Uhm... My anaconda don't want none / unless you got buns hon... I'm a terrible father!",val
Chandler Bing,Hi!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey... hey listen... What do you guys know about investments?,val
Chandler Bing,How come?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I'm starting to make good money on the show and I'm thinking... I should probably do something with it.",val
Monica Geller,What do you do with your money now?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I just tape it to the back of my toilet tank. I didn't say that! It's in a bank guarded by robots!",val
Chandler Bing,Do you have any ideas?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, yeah... This guy at work got me excited about going in on an emu farm. That'd be kinda cool huh? Pitchin' in on the weekends, helping to plant the emus...",val
Monica Geller,Joe... Emus are birds. You raise them for meat.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! Right! People eat birds... Bird meat... Now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to... you go to a restaurant and you say: ""Excuse me, I'll have a bucket of fried bird."" Or... or maybe just a wing or...",val
Monica Geller,"Joey, I think you should consider something a little less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. That's right, I know some stuff!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Real estate, huh? Hmmm...",val
Monica Geller,"Oh, and you know who's selling a great apartment? Richard!",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, and you know whose knowledge of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!",val
Monica Geller,My dad told me. They play golf together.,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, well... Maybe I'll join them some time. I just hope the club doesn't slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Hi!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Listen! You have to help me pick a dress 'cause I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight!,val
Monica Geller,"Wow, the boyfriend's parents! That's a big step.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Really? That hadn't occurred to me.,val
Monica Geller,"They just gonna love you, just be yourself.",val
Phoebe Buffay,They live on the upper east side on Park Avenue!,val
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, she can't be herself.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, so... allright... Which dress? You can say ""neither"".",val
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry honey, but we're gonna take you shopping. It's gonna be fine.",val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, totally! You are in such good hands. And I'm so good with meeting parents. With the father, you know, you want to flirt a little bit, but not in a gross way. Just kind of like: ""Oh mr. Pincer, I can see where Wallis gets his good looks...""",val
Monica Geller,You went out with Wallis Pincer?,val
Rachel Green,"Uh, he took the SAT's for me.",val
Monica Geller,I knew you didn't get a 1400!,val
Rachel Green,"Ssshyeah, well, duh! I mean...",val
Phoebe Buffay,So... now... What about with Mike's mom?,val
Rachel Green,"Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had.",val
Monica Geller,She said WHAT?,val
Phoebe Buffay,That's she's like the daughter she never had. Listen!,val
Rachel Green,Hi.,val
Ross Geller,Hi.,val
Rachel Green,"I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet!",val
Ross Geller,Guess what? I made Emma laugh today.,val
Rachel Green,You WHAT? And I missed it? Because I was giving a makeover to that stupid hippie?,val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, and it was uhm... it was like a real little person laugh too. It was... it was like uhm... Only... only not creepy.",val
Rachel Green,"Well... well, what did you do to make her laugh?",val
Ross Geller,"I uhm... Well, I sang... well actually I rapped... Baby Got Back...",val
Rachel Green,You WHAT? You sang... to our baby daughter... a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses?,val
Ross Geller,"But you know what, if you think about it, it actually promotes a healthy uhm... body image... because... even big butts or uhm... juicy doubles.",val
Rachel Green,owwwww...,val
Ross Geller,Please don't take her away from me!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.,val
Chandler Bing,So how come Richard's selling the place? Went bankrupt? Medical malpractice? Choked on his own moustache?,val
Chandler Bing,mmm That's enough about you!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Is there anything we should know about the apartment?,val
Chandler Bing,"No, no, no, no, no, NO! No, no... we're not together. We're not a couple. We're definately not a couple.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, you seem pretty insulted by that. What? I'm not good enough for you?",val
Chandler Bing,"We're not gonna have this conversation again... Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing Monica to a real man! You don't think he's here, do you?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"You know what it is? It's a nice place but I gotta see I don't know if I see myself living here. Oh, oh, oh, let me see... Yeah, I could see it.",val
Chandler Bing,"Look at these videos. You know, I mean, who does he think he is? Magnum Force, Dirty Harry, Cool Hand Luke... Oh my God!",val
Joey Tribbiani,What?,val
Chandler Bing,There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh! A tape with a girls name on it. It's probably a sex tape... Wait a minute... This says Monica... And this is Richard's apartment...,val
Chandler Bing,Get there faster!,val
Phoebe Buffay,I'm wearing pantyhose!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, thank you! Oh... Oh my God, you're RICH!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, so... They gotta die someday. HELLO!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Theodore... Bitsy... What a delight!,val
Phoebe Buffay,And you... Your home is lovely.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Holy crap!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, try and stop me!",val
Phoebe Buffay,I'm trying to get your parents to like me.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Got it! It... It's hard to stop...,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Uhm... Okay, well, allright, uhm... Originally I'm from upstate, but uhm... then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison, so... I just moved to the city where uhm... I actually lived in a burned out Buick LeSabre for a while... which was okay, that was okay, until uhm... I got hepatitis, you know, 'cause this pimp spit in my mouth and... but I... I got over it and uhm... anyway, now I'm uhm... a freelance massage therapist, uhm... which, you know, isn't always steady money but at least I don't pay taxes, huh... So... where does everyone summer?",val
Phoebe Buffay,God! God! This is not going well.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, okay, okay, okay... Still sure about me being myself?",val
Phoebe Buffay,So Theodore... I uhm... I can see where Mike gets his good looks from...,val
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah... And that physique! You must work out all the time...,val
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah I bet! Look out!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, are you okay?",val
Phoebe Buffay,I'm so sorry!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"I really, really am sorry.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes... I'm sorry, I've never met a boyfriends parents before...",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah okay... yeah, your mom... okay... She looks nice, I can talk to her.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah... Oh Bitsy, hi. Uhm... listen I just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Also uhm... I just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, and you know, it really is a testament to how he was raised. Especially to you. Because he's very respectful of women.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Are you kidding. He is so considerate of my feelings and... you know I think... you'd also like to know that he is a very gentle lover.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get me wrong. No, he's not in like a sissy way. No, no, no... when he gets going, he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave...",val
Chandler Bing,"I'm not gonna watch it... I don't NEED to watch it... I mean, what good could possibly come from watching? Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey dude, what's up?",val
Chandler Bing,"Don't judge me, I'm only human!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Did you take that tape?,val
Chandler Bing,"I had to! Okay, imagine you were married... and you found a tape of your wife in another guys' apartment... Wouldn't you need to know what was on it?",val
Joey Tribbiani,I don't know. Who'm I'm married to?,val
Chandler Bing,Some girl...!?,val
Joey Tribbiani,She hot?,val
Chandler Bing,Yeah...!?,val
Joey Tribbiani,How did she get me to settle down?,val
Chandler Bing,"Allright, I'm gonna watch it... I mean look, it's probably not even what I think it is... And even if it is... It can't possibly be as bad as what I'm picturing in my head... Can it?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Guess I don't know. My experience: if a girl says yes to being taped... She doesn't say no to much else, I tell ya...",val
Chandler Bing,Then you're gonna have to watch it for me.,val
Joey Tribbiani,What? Whoo... What?,val
Chandler Bing,"Just for a few seconds, so I can know what it is... Please?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, fine... But if I enjoy this, you have only yourself to blame...",val
Chandler Bing,Why am I hearing cheering?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Well it's okay, its like... its just a football game.",val
Chandler Bing,Football? Just football?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, see... you were all worried for nothing.",val
Chandler Bing,It's football... It's just football... This is great! This is the first time I've ever enjoyed football... It may be customary to get a beer... What the... What are you doing?,val
Joey Tribbiani,You don't wanna see what I just saw!,val
Monica Geller,"What are you guys doing? Oh my God, is that Richard?",val
Rachel Green,"Okay... aahhh... Please laugh for mommy... Please? Please laugh for mommy... Not funny huh? Oh so, is it... only offensive novelty rap? Or maybe just, you know, rap in general? 'Cause mommy can rap... My name is mommy and I'm here to say / that all the babies are... Oh, I can't rap... Allright sweetheart... This is only because I love you so much, and I know that you're not gonna tell anybody... I like... big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... / when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face... Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! Oohhhhh! Oh! I like big butts and I cannot lie... / You other brothers can't deny... Oh Emma you're laughing! Oh you are, you really do like big butts, don't you. Oh you beautiful little weirdo...",val
Ross Geller,Hey!,val
Rachel Green,"Oh you missed it. She was laughing. Oh it was amazing. It was amazing. It was the most beautiful, beautiful sound that...",val
Ross Geller,"Oh I know, isn't it? Ooh... what'd you do to get her to laugh?",val
Rachel Green,"Oh! You know, I just... couple of things I tried ... I just sang a little doo... Itsy Bitsy Spider...",val
Ross Geller,You sang Baby Got Back didn't you?,val
Rachel Green,Nothing else worked. That girl is all about the ass...,val
Phoebe Buffay,"...and then it goes back to the chorus... Smelly cat, Sme-lly ca-t / I-t's not your fau-lt. And that's the end of the song... I realise that you didn't ask to hear it, but uhm... no-one had spoken in seventeen minutes.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Pervert Parade?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Ode To A Pubic Hair?",val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh God! Is that veal?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, no, no, no... That's okay, that's okay... I mean, I'm... I am a vegetarian... except for veal... Yeah no, veal I love...",val
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, no, I actually it's any baby animals: kittens, fish babies... You know... especially veal... and this, this nice vein of fat running through it... Hmmm... yummy Hmmm...",val
Monica Geller,So you stole that tape from Richard's apartment?,val
Chandler Bing,Whoho ho... Listen to the judgement from the porn star!,val
Monica Geller,That tape was never meant to be seen by... Joey I would feel more comfortable if I was having this conversation in private.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica, look... I don't think you and I have any secrets anymore... Not ready to joke about it yet, okay, I see you later.",val
Monica Geller,Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it?,val
Chandler Bing,"Because that's who I am, okay? I'm sure a mature man like Richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. Just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches.",val
Monica Geller,Is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache?,val
Chandler Bing,This is about you and Richard. He's clearly not over you. He keeps a tape so he can... look at it whenever he wants.,val
Monica Geller,"Isn't that sad? I mean, can you see how pathetic that is? You shouldn't be jealous. You should feel bad for him.",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard. Y'... I can grow a moustache!",val
Monica Geller,"Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each other. That's all that matters.",val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, oh, but I just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...",val
Monica Geller,Cowboy boots? I've never worn cowboy boots in my whole life!,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, good, good. Play more, 'cause I wanna see how it ends.",val
Monica Geller,THAT'S NOT ME!,val
Chandler Bing,What...? That's not you! Life is good again! Ride 'em cowgirl!,val
Monica Geller,That bastard taped over me!,val
Chandler Bing,Is that a problem?,val
Monica Geller,"I-It's just so insulting! Big spring for a new blank tape, Doctor!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah... The woman you what?,val
Phoebe Buffay,I love you too...,val
Phoebe Buffay,YEAH...! How great is this...?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.,val
Phoebe Buffay,I had a great time. It was really top drawer. And Here's Something Rich thirteen bathrooms in this place... I threw up in the coat closet... Ta taaa...,val
Ross Geller,"She sweat, wet. got it going like a turbo 'vette.",val
Rachel Green,So fellas.,val
Ross Geller,Yeah!,val
Rachel Green,fellas.,val
Ross Geller,Yeah!,val
Rachel Green,has your girlfriend got the butt?,val
Ross Geller,Hell yeah!,val
Rachel Green,So shake it!,val

Rachel Green,Shake that nasty butt...,val
Ross Geller,Baby got back.,val
Rachel Green,"One more time from the top... I like big butts and I cannot lie, you other br...",val
Ross Geller,Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!,val
Monica Geller,"Hey Hon, could you help me get the plates down?",val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah. Hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our wedding china today?",val
Monica Geller,"No, I think we should save our china for something really special. Like if the Queen of England comes over.",val
Chandler Bing,"Honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.",val
Monica Geller,"What if something gets broken, they're so expensive.",val
Chandler Bing,What is the point of having them if we never use them?,val
Monica Geller,"Ok, but if something gets broken, and then the Queen comes over..",val
Chandler Bing,I will explain it to her.,val
Monica Geller,"Oh yeah, like I'm going to let you talk to the queen.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"wow, the parade is really good this year. Man those horses can crap.",val
Chandler Bing,Muskogee! That's like four hours from Tulsa. Woo hoo!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God!,val
Chandler Bing,Aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap Days of Our Lives?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! I totally forgot I'm supposed to be there. I can't believe I forgot. I usually write stuff like this on my arm. Oh! Stupid long sleeves.,val
Chandler Bing,What are you going to do?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"I guess I'm going to have to come up with a really good reason why I wasn't there. The producers are going to be so mad at me. They sat us all down yesterday and said ""Everyone has to be there at 6:00 AM sharp, that means you Tribbiani."" Like.. like I was some kind of idiot.",val
Chandler Bing,Well you proved them wrong.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Ross and Rachels Apartment.,val
Rachel Green,Oh Emma. This is going to be your first Thanksgiving. What are you thankful for? Mommy's bobbies.,val
Ross Geller,A lot of people are thankful for those.,val
Rachel Green,Who is it?,val
Rachel Green,Hide my rings.,val
Rachel Green,Oh. Amy! Happy Thanksgiving.,val
Rachel Green,Um... hi.,val
Rachel Green,Aw.,val
Rachel Green,I haven't seen you in like.. a year.,val
Rachel Green,Oh well yeah me too. Um.. I had a baby.,val
Rachel Green,"Oh.. yeah? Well unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina, not the same thing.",val
Rachel Green,mh hmm..,val
Rachel Green,Uh.... its Emma.,val
Ross Geller,Hey Amy.,val
Rachel Green,"Oh Amy, you remember Ross.",val
Ross Geller,That was me.,val
Monica Geller,Careful. Careful. CAREFUL! Sorry.,val
Chandler Bing,"I'll tell you what, for the rest of our lives, I'll be careful until told otherwise. hey wait a minute this isn't the china we picked out..",val
Monica Geller,"I know, after you left the store, I chose different ones.",val
Chandler Bing,Why?,val
Monica Geller,"well no offense honey, but your taste is a little feminine for me.",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, everybody. Happy Thanksgiving!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey happy Thanksgiving.. Pheebs!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, what's going on Joe?",val
Joey Tribbiani,I.. I.. I need a good lie.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh okay. How about the whole ""man walking on the moon"" thing. You know? You. you could. You could see the strings people!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no I need a good lie to explain why I wasn't at a work thing today.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, honey. You stink at lying.",val
Joey Tribbiani,I do not.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh really. Okay. let me ask you something. Yesterday at the coffee house, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, my muffin was gone-who took it?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in, went straight for your muffin and I said ""Hey don't eat that-that's Phoebe's"" and he said.. He said.. ""Joey you stink at lying."" What am I going to do?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Don't worry, don't worry. We'll come up with a good lie. I'll help you practice it.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh great, that'd be great. Thank you.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Sure, what.. what was the work thing?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Uh..,val
Phoebe Buffay,"""Pick up grandma at the airport""?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh.. man.. Ross and Rachel's Apartment.,val
Rachel Green,Amy! Yes I do.. I really do.,val
Ross Geller,"Sure, we don't live there but...",val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, no. Ross has a PhD.",val
Rachel Green,God she is unbelievable.,val
Ross Geller,"I know, I mean a PhD is just as good as an MD.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh sure Ross, yeah. If I have a heart attack in a restaurant, I want you there with your fossil brush.",val
Rachel Green,What? What happened?,val
Ross Geller,Don't say that.,val
Rachel Green,"Oh Amy, don't cry Amy. Um.. Ross, could I talk to you in private?",val
Ross Geller,"Sure, you want to go upstairs?",val
Rachel Green,Um look I was thinking.. If its ok with Monica I would like to invite Amy to Thanksgiving.,val
Ross Geller,"You know, I think thats a great idea. It'll be like the pilgrims bringing the Indians syphilis.",val
Rachel Green,"Look I know she's a little tough to take. She has no where else to go, and she's my sister. Alright, she's Emma's aunt. And I would like them to bond.",val
Ross Geller,"Ok, fine, but I don't want them bonding to much. I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job.",val
Rachel Green,"Ross, you know what? She may need one..We're just going to have to make our peace with that! Monica and Chandler's apartment.",val
Rachel Green,Hi.,val
Rachel Green,"Hey you guys, this is my sister Amy. This is Chandler, Joey, Phoebe and you know Mon.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Hap.. Hap.. Happy Thanksgiving.,val
Ross Geller,Hi.,val
Monica Geller,Hi.,val
Monica Geller,Hey you.,val
Monica Geller,So. Welcome. Is this your first time you're seeing Emma?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Phoe-Be.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Pheebs, I still need some help here.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh right, ok um. Ok so its not just the lie you tell. but its the way you tell it. . For example if you look down at the ground when you're talking, people know you're lying.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh.. I don't know why this is so hard for me. you know.. I mean lying is basically just acting and I am a terrfic actor.,val
Phoebe Buffay,You are a terrific actor.,val
Rachel Green,Oh we just put her down for a nap.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Thats a great movie.,val
Ross Geller,Emma.,val
Phoebe Buffay,PHOE-BE.,val
Rachel Green,"Honey, I don't know how to tell you this, but um, if something were to happen to Ross or to myself um you wouldn't get the baby.",val
Ross Geller,"Well we haven't offically asked them yet, but we would want Monica and Chandler.",val
Chandler Bing,I can't believe you'd want us to raise Emma.,val
Monica Geller,"yeah oh my god, I'm so moved.",val
Rachel Green,"See look Amy, we're a lot closer to Monica and Chandler. We see them every day. And truthfully honey, you don't seem very connected to the baby.",val
Chandler Bing,"You know, guys I got to say. This means so much to me. That you would trust me with your child. I mean, we all know that Monica and I have been trying to have a baby of our own. You know I've had my doubts about my skills as a father, but that you two.. that you two....",val
Monica Geller,Okay! It's time for dinner. Everyone we're using our fancy china.. um and its very expensive so please be careful.,val
Ross Geller,Woah. Woah... Woah.,val
Monica Geller,"Okay, just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved. Ross makes some sort of sound to let us know it hurt.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! How come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's? Do you not trust me with a fancy plate?,val
Monica Geller,"No, honey, its. thats a special plate. See its a game, whoever gets that plate wins.",val
Joey Tribbiani,I can't believe I won.,val
Rachel Green,Monica is Ross' sister.,val
Monica Geller,That was me.,val
Rachel Green,"Hey. Amy. You've got to stop doing that. Monica about to have a heart attack: Okay, listen I know you're having a little bit of a family crisis, but you don't have to take it out on the plates. I mean, I mean in fact I think that everyone should cut their food like this.",val
Monica Geller,"Now see, this way you protect the plate.. and lets face it you have fun.",val
Chandler Bing,"No, if crazy plate lad.. If Monica dies then I would get Emma, Right?",val
Rachel Green,Well actually...,val
Chandler Bing,Actually what?,val
Ross Geller,"well.. its just. its just in that case, then um. Emma would go to my parents.",val
Chandler Bing,What?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Uh.. who has to die for me to get her? Commercial Break.,val
Chandler Bing,"So if Monica's not around, then I'm not good enough to raise Emma?",val
Ross Geller,"No, that that is not what we're saying.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah he's lying. He looked down.,val
Chandler Bing,Well what is wrong with me? Am I .. am I incomptent? Because I managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!,val
Rachel Green,"Honey, you're taking this the wrong way. We think you're going to be a wonderful parent. It's just.. you're more the fun parent.",val
Ross Geller,Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh. uh discliplinarin.. someone who can be firm and strict.,val
Monica Geller,"Thats not how you see me, is it? Phoebe while cutting a sweet potatoe in the air: No you're all about the fun.",val
Chandler Bing,"Look, I may not know a lot about babies, but do you really think I'm not capable?",val
Ross Geller,"No, you both are equally capable. Its just.. you're strongest when.. when you're together.",val
Chandler Bing,Ok. So if we both had Emma and I die she'd have to give her up.,val
Ross Geller,"Sure, Monica would have to give her up.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"I lie better then that, right?",val
Chandler Bing,"So.. let me get this straight. So my two friends die, I get Emma. Then my wife dies, then Emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me?",val
Phoebe Buffay,There's your movie! Later on. Monica opens her front door. Chandler is sitting in the hallway.,val
Monica Geller,Hey. There you are. You disappeared after dinner.,val
Chandler Bing,Oh? Did somebody miss me? Is there a child to raise poorly?,val
Monica Geller,Ross and Rachel don't know what they're talking about. I mean its not like their so responsible. Emma is a product of a bottle of Merlot and a five year old condom.,val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah but they're right. I mean, I'm not a strong father figure and I never will be.",val
Monica Geller,No you learn these things. You grow into it.,val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, but its not who I am. Everything they said was exaclty why I was worried about having a kid. And its true. And look everybody knows it.",val
Monica Geller,I don't know it! I want to have a kid with you because I think you're going to be an amazing dad... at the fun parts and the hard parts.,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, well can you picture me saying ""Go to your room! You're grounded""?",val
Monica Geller,"Can you hear me say ""You're grounded""?",val
Chandler Bing,You said that to me last week.,val
Monica Geller,How hard is it? No shoes on the furniture. Back to Monica and Chandler's apartment. Amy is sitting on a chair by the bay window looking mad. Joey groans and gets off the phone: The producer from Days left a message on my machine asking why I wasn't at the parade. They said everybody's pissed off at me.. And they all got to meet Santa!,val
Phoebe Buffay,It's ok. I thought of the perfect lie for you. It's easy to remember and doesn't invite a lot of questions. You weren't at the parade because you had a family emergency.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I like that, yeah. Wasn't at the parade because I had a family emergency.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, what happened? Joey all nervous and looking down and fiddling with his ear: Oh.. My sister's raccoon.",val
Phoebe Buffay,No! Nothing with a raccoon.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Arg... Alright, I'll take care of it. Monica and Chandler come through the front door.",val
Monica Geller,Oh wait.. What are you doing?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Setting the table.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too.,val
Monica Geller,Oh how nice. Maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress. Ross comes out of the guest bedroom with the diaper bag and the car seat carrying thingy.. yeah.. thats the techinal term.. He goes to Chandler.,val
Ross Geller,"Hey dude, you okay? Sorry about before.",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh no thats okay, you're totally right. I don't know anything about disciplining a child. But it did hurt my feelings and I want you to know that when I die, you don't get Joey. Ross walks away with a face of yeah ok. Amy walks over to the couch and sits down next to Rachel: Ucch. Uchh In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not talking to you.",val
Rachel Green,UCHH!,val
Rachel Green,Yeah.. yeah right.. Remember in high school when I died and didn't give you my baby?,val
Rachel Green,What? What carrer?,val
Rachel Green,Ok. You decorate dad's office and so now you're a decorator. Okay! I went to the zoo yesterday and now I'm a koala bear.,val
Rachel Green,Sup.. You want to talk supportive? You didn't even come and visit me when I was in the hospital having the baby.,val
Rachel Green,I did the first time! Oh. Oh.. And you know what. You want to know why I'm not giving Emily to you.,val
Ross Geller,Emma.,val
Rachel Green,Oh whose side are you on? I'm not giving you Emma because there is no way you could handle the responibility of a child.,val
Joey Tribbiani,ooh oooh..,val
Rachel Green,uh huh.,val
Rachel Green,"Jealous of what? Of your lack of responsiblity? You, your immaturity? Your total disregard of other people's feelings?",val
Rachel Green,Timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him!,val
Rachel Green,"I cannot, I cannot believe that I invited you here today.",val
Rachel Green,ah ha ha. ah ha ha. It's forty five.,val
Ross Geller,"Too far, Amy. Too far.",val
Rachel Green,You take that back.,val
Rachel Green,Take it back!,val
Rachel Green,"Heey man, I work out.",val
Rachel Green,I do pilates.,val
Rachel Green,Bring it on!,val
Monica Geller,Put the plates in the boxes!! Put the plates in the boxes!,val
Rachel Green,Did you just push me?,val
Rachel Green,Alright. Thats it!,val
Monica Geller,Forget the bubblewrap! There isn't time! Rachel starts messing up Amy's hair: Frizzy frizzy frizzy frizzy!!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my god! Shouldn't we stop this?,val
Joey Tribbiani,What? Are you out of your mind? Lets throw some jello on them.,val
Rachel Green,Ew! Gross.,val
Chandler Bing,"Alright! That is it. This is our apartment and you can not behave this way. Now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't be here at all. Now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones I picked out, but they're very important to Monica. I want you to apologize to her right now.",val
Rachel Green,"Mon, I'm so sorry.",val
Chandler Bing,Okay. Thats better. Now I want you to both apologize to each other and mean it.,val
Chandler Bing,"By the way, that fight was totally arousing.",val
Ross Geller,"Dude. Well done. You know what? If I die, and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma.",val
Chandler Bing,Oh yeah? Well thanks.,val
Ross Geller,"So, so now do I get Joey?",val
Chandler Bing,"Okay, but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose.",val
Rachel Green,Are you okay Mon?,val
Monica Geller,uh huh.. I mean these things happen. Its' just a plate. Its not like somebody died.,val
Phoebe Buffay,It's all right. You can mourn.,val
Monica Geller,Thank you. It was so beautiful. I'm going to go to Joeys and get the pies.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Actually its not pies, its just pie.",val
Monica Geller,I don't care. Oh my god. I've lost the will to scold.,val
Rachel Green,"Look Amy, it got a little of control..Um.. and I'm sorry. You're my sister and uh.. if it really means that much to you..",val
Rachel Green,Uh. No.. I was going to let you use my Ralph Lauren discount.,val
Rachel Green,She needs changing.,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh no no no.. I'll get her. I'm super-compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise Emma. I'll be right there Emma. Just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. Well.. what do you know? I guess, I'll be the one who dies first.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, does Monica know about her broken plates yet?",val
Chandler Bing,Nope...,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Broke them all, huh?",val
Chandler Bing,Yep...,val
Phoebe Buffay,You gonna tell her?,val
Chandler Bing,"Nope... Hey... so I'm gonna... put the plates back. You know, I think you were right, I don't think we should use these plates again for a looong time.",val
Monica Geller,Like only if the queen comes?,val
Chandler Bing,Maybe not even then.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! I did it. I called my producer. I told him I had a family emergency, he totally bought it. Thanks for teaching me how to lie Pheebs.",val
Phoebe Buffay,No problem! Next week: stealing...,val
Monica Geller,Bye plates!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you told her you broke all the plates, huh?",val
Monica Geller,What? Something happened with the plates?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Uhm... Yeah... this uhm... raccoon came in...,val
Chandler Bing,Yep. That's a lot of cats Jo Lynn. Single are ya?,val
Chandler Bing,Chandler Bing.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey. How come you're answering your own phone? Where's your crazy assistant?,val
Chandler Bing,What's up Joe?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, what have we always wanted to do together?",val
Chandler Bing,Braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no. When you get home tomorrow night, you and I are going to be at the Wizzards-Knicks game . . . courtside!",val
Chandler Bing,Courtside? Oh my God.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah. Maybe Michael Jordon will dive for the ball and break my jaw with his knee.,val
Chandler Bing,That's so cool. I'll let Monica know.,val
Monica Geller,Hello?,val
Chandler Bing,Joey just called. He's got courtside Knicks tickets for him and me tomorrow night.,val
Monica Geller,"Really? But tomorrow night is the only night I get off from the restaurant. If you go to the game, we won't have a night together for another week.",val
Chandler Bing,"But hey, it's courtside. The cheerleaders are going to be right in fr. . . That's not the way to convince you.",val
Monica Geller,"Chandler look, I don't want to be one of those wives who says, ""You can't go to the game. You have to spend time with me."" So, if you could just realize it on your own . . .",val
Chandler Bing,"I know. You're right. I want to see you too. I've just got to figure out a way to tell Joey, you know? He's really looking forward to this.",val
Monica Geller,Tell him that you haven't seen your wife in a long time. Tell him that having a long-distance relationship is really difficult. Tell him that what little time we have is precious.,val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, ah, ah . . . I'll think of something.",val
Ross Geller,"Wow! Wow, You look . . . uh . . . It's just, ah . . . That dress . . . uh . . .",val
Rachel Green,"Well, I hope the ends of these sentences are good.",val
Ross Geller,"Well, well, they're good. It's been a while since I've seen you like this. You, you clean up good.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh well, well thank you. Okay, stop. Stop looking at me like that. The last time that happened, that happened.",val
Ross Geller,"Oh right, right. So, are you . . . ah . . . you excited about your, your first night away from Emma?",val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, yeah. Phoebe and I are going to have so much fun. And thank you for watching the baby, by the way.",val
Ross Geller,"Oh, it's fine. Actually, I, I invited Mike over.",val
Rachel Green,Phoebe's Mike?,val
Ross Geller,Yeah.,val
Rachel Green,I didn't know you guys hung out.,val
Ross Geller,"We don't. But I thought it would be nice to get to know him. You know, maybe have a little dinner, drinks, conversation.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh that's so cute: Ross and Mike's first date. Is that going to be awkward? I mean, what are you guys going to talk about?",val
Ross Geller,"I don't know. But, you know, we, we have a lot in common, you know. He plays piano; I played keyboards in college. He's been divorced; I have some experience in that area.",val
Rachel Green,Yeah.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.,val
Rachel Green,Hey.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Oooh. Girl's night out indeed.,val
Rachel Green,"Ok. So now, I think Emma is probably down for the night, but if you need anything Ross . . .",val
Ross Geller,"Rach, Rach, we'll be fine, all right? You go have fun.",val
Rachel Green,Okay. You too. And I hope you score. Bye.,val
Ross Geller,So . . . Welcome.,val
Ross Geller,I got bottled breast milk.,val
Ross Geller,"Okay. So, um, Phoebe tells me you, ah, you play piano.",val
Ross Geller,"You know, I, I used to, ah, play keyboards in college.",val
Ross Geller,No.,val
Ross Geller,"Um . . . ah . . . you know, I'm divorced. Um, Phoebe, ah . . . Phoebe said you . . . You've been divorced?",val
Ross Geller,That's okay. We'll talk about something else.,val
Ross Geller,Yeah.,val
Ross Geller,"Ah? Well, he and I would probably have a lot to talk about.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh God. Remember the girls' nights we used to have sitting around talking about you and Ross?,val
Rachel Green,Oh God. It seems like forever ago.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"I know. So, what's going on with you and Ross?",val
Rachel Green,"Well, um . . . I don't know. I mean, for a long time nothing. But you know, actually right before you picked me up, Ross and I had a . . . ah . . . little thing.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God! I love things. What happened?,val
Rachel Green,"Well, um, first he told me he liked how I looked. And, ah, then we had a little . . . um . . . eye-contact.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Eye-contact?,val
Rachel Green,Mm-hmm.,val
Phoebe Buffay,I hope you were using protection.,val
Rachel Green,Oh. Should we send them something back?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Oooh. Let's do. Let's send them mashed potatoes.,val
Rachel Green,"No! Wait! No, no. Don't do that! That's going to make them think they can come over here.",val
Phoebe Buffay,So? What if they do?,val
Rachel Green,"Well, we're not here to meet guys. You have a boyfriend, I have a b. . . baby and a Ross.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, but, ah, ah, nothing has to happen. We're just having fun. You know, not everything had to go as far as ""eye-contact.""",val
Monica Geller,"Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.",val
Chandler Bing,"Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me, than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? I heard it.",val
Monica Geller,I don't want him to think that I'm having an affair.,val
Chandler Bing,All right. I've got a plan. I'll go down the fire escape.,val
Monica Geller,"Yes, because all good plans start with, ""I'll go down the fire escape.""",val
Chandler Bing,"Hear me out woman. I'll go down the fire escape. Then, I'll wait for a while. Then, when I come up the stairs, it'll be just like I just got back from Tulsa. Then, Joey and I will come in and see that there's no guy in here.",val
Monica Geller,Aren't you afraid that Joey's going to figure all of this out? I heard it.,val
Chandler Bing,I'm just going to wait for a little while.,val
Monica Geller,Scary pigeon's back?,val
Chandler Bing,It's huge.,val
Rachel Green,Oh my God. I can't believe you live in that building. My grandmother lives in that building. Ida Green? No sense of personal space? Kind of smells like chicken? Looks like a potato.,val
Rachel Green,That's my bubby!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. . . I'm sorry. We weren't really looking for anything to happen with you guys. I, I have a boyfriend.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, well, it's complicated. I don't actually have a boyfriend. But um. . .",val
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, no.",val
Rachel Green,Oh sure.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, you're giving your real number.",val
Rachel Green,Great.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Bye. Wow. So, that's great. You, Bill, Ross, and Emma are going to be so happy together. What were you thinking?",val
Rachel Green,"I don't know. He was cute, and he liked me. It was an impulse.",val
Phoebe Buffay,What about Ross? What about your moment? Don't you want to talk to Ross about it?,val
Rachel Green,"No. No, because I know exactly how the conversation's gonna go. ""Hey Ross, you know, I think we had a moment before.""",val
Rachel Green,"""Yeah."" ""Me too.""",val
Rachel Green,"""Well, but I'm not sure I really want to do anything about it.""",val
Rachel Green,"""Yeah."" ""Me neither.""",val
Rachel Green,"""Well, should we just continue to live together and not really tell each other how we're really feeling?""",val
Rachel Green,"""Yeah. That works for me.""",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I see what you mean. By the way, nice Ross imitation.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, thanks.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"But, your Rachel wasn't whiny enough.",val
Rachel Green,Wha. . . hey!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Better!,val
Rachel Green,"Well, the point is, maybe I should just stop waiting around for moments with Ross, you know? I should just . . . move on with my life.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Really? You're moving on from Ross?,val
Rachel Green,I don't know. Do I have to decide right now?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, you kind of just did. That guy is going to call you tonight. Ross is going to pick up the phone and that's a pretty clear message.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh God, Ross. Ross is going to pick up the phone. Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"""Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh my God. He's gone."" Dead on.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow! That didn't take long. I thought you said Tulsa was, like a three hour flight.",val
Chandler Bing,"Well, you're forgetting about the time difference.",val
Monica Geller,Chandler! You're home!,val
Chandler Bing,"That's right. You're husband's home. So, now the sex can stop.",val
Monica Geller,What are you saying?,val
Chandler Bing,Joey said that you're in here with another man.,val
Monica Geller,There's no man in here. How dare you accuse me of that.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"All right. All right. Then, maybe you won't mind if me and my friend take a look around, huh? Bwa-ah-ah!",val
Chandler Bing,What is he doing?,val
Monica Geller,I arranged some pillows on the bed to look like a guy.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Bedroom is clear, although you might need some new pillows.",val
Chandler Bing,"All right. Well, I'll check the guest room.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Why do I smell men's cologne?,val
Monica Geller,I think that's you.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh yeah. I rubbed a magazine on myself earlier.,val
Chandler Bing,There's nobody here Joe.,val
Joey Tribbiani,I guess not.,val
Monica Geller,I can't believe you thought I was cheating. You own me an apology.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, right Monica. I'm so sorry.",val
Monica Geller,"Ah, it's an honest mistake. It could happen to anyone. All right, see ya.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you just got back from Tulsa, how did your suitcase beat you here?",val
Chandler Bing,I climb down the fire escape and you can't put that in the closet?,val
Ross Geller,"Maybe you should look up ""fascinating.""",val
Ross Geller,I don't understand what just happened here.,val
Joey Tribbiani,What's going on?,val
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry. I, I told you I was in Tulsa because I wanted to spend the night with Monica and I, I didn't know . . . I didn't think you'd understand.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"What? You think I'm too dumb to understand that a husband needs to be with his wife? Huh? Do you think I'm like, ""Duh.""",val
Monica Geller,Joey?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah?,val
Monica Geller,I don't know what to say. We shouldn't have lied to you.,val
Chandler Bing,Yeah. I feel so bad. Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you could go to the game with me, ah, even though I know you said you couldn't. But then you lied to me and tricked me and gave me a bump on the head.",val
Chandler Bing,I'm sorry. That's the one thing I can't do. I promised I'd be with Monica.,val
Joey Tribbiani,All right.,val
Monica Geller,You can go.,val
Chandler Bing,What?,val
Monica Geller,You should go to the game. It's okay. I want you to.,val
Chandler Bing,Really? You're gonna be okay?,val
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I'll be fine. You know, maybe I'll stay here and practice the art of seduction.",val
Chandler Bing,"You're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?",val
Monica Geller,It's gonna be so hot!,val
Chandler Bing,"Okay, bye.",val
Monica Geller,Have fun.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks. Here's your ticket.,val
Chandler Bing,"Hey, listen. I'm never going to lie to you again, okay? And I want you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks man.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Where are you going?,val
Chandler Bing,Game's tomorrow night Joe.,val
Ross Geller,Hey you guys.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Hey. I'll be right back. I've got to go to the bathroom.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"...sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle;and away they all flew like the down of a thistle; but I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, ""Merry Christmas to all, and to all a goodnight!""",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, that was great! You really wrote that?",val
Phoebe Buffay,Uh-huh.,val
Chandler Bing,"Say goodbye elves, I'm off to Tulsa.",val
Monica Geller,I can't believe you're not gonna be here for Christmas.,val
Ross Geller,You're really not coming back?,val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year. If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.",val
Monica Geller,"It's so unfair, you don't even like your job!",val
Chandler Bing,"So, who does?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I like my job.",val
Joey Tribbiani,I *love* my job.,val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I can't *wait* to go back to work.",val
Ross Geller,I can't get *enough* dinosaurs!,val
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry, I won't be here.",val
Monica Geller,"It's just... It's hard enough not seeing you during the week, but for Christmas... alright, if this is what you have to do, I understand.",val
Chandler Bing,Thanks. I'll see you New Year's Day.,val
Monica Geller,You're not gonna be here New Year's Eve??,val
Chandler Bing,Did I not mention that?,val
Monica Geller,No!,val
Chandler Bing,AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT! *Opening Credits*,val
Chandler Bing,"All right everybody, I know that it's Christmas Eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call for writing ""Screw you, Mr. Bing!"" on the back of my chair! -- By the way, you can all call me Chandler.",val
Chandler Bing,Hey. Where've you been?,val
Chandler Bing,"You hear that? You may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.",val
Chandler Bing,"Y'know what, I know what will cheer you guys up! I had a little talk with the boys in New York, told 'em about all the hard work you've been doing and that a little Christmas bonus may be in order.",val
Chandler Bing,"Well, that's like money in your pocket! - Alright look, you want me to say it? This sucks. Being here sucks! This work sucks!",val
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry. Hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. I have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. And then tomorrow morning, you get to have Christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.",val
Chandler Bing,"Haha, no thanks!",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, thanks! I'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.",val
Chandler Bing,"Typical Christmas-y stuff, you know? Our holidays are pretty traditional...",val
Phoebe Buffay,"So here is a, a very special holiday song that I wrote for some very important people to me. ""Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap. Asked him to bring my friends all kinds of crap. Said all you need is to write them a song. Now, you haven't heard it yet, so don't try to sing along. No, don't sing along. Monica, Moncia, have a happy Hanukkah. Saw Santa Claus, he said hello to Ross. And please tell Joey, Christmas will be snowy! And Rachel and Chandler, have err-umm-glander!!"" Happy holidays, everybody!",val
Rachel Green,"Okay, Pheebs, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.",val
Chandler Bing,"I can save you time ladies, I'm right here.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you.",val
Rachel Green,We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.,val
Chandler Bing,What? That's terrible!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"No-no, we do it every year!",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"No, yeah, we never find them! She's always best at us, that wily... minx.",val
Rachel Green,"Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?",val
Chandler Bing,"No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, we have to!",val
Chandler Bing,"No, you don't have to, and you can't because I, I live here too.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well then, you should look with us.",val
Chandler Bing,Why?,val
Rachel Green,"Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?",val
Chandler Bing,"No, I have a great idea for a present for her.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, that's it? A great idea! Oh yeah.",val
Rachel Green,"Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?",val
Chandler Bing,"If I help, we can find 'em faster!",val
Rachel Green,That's right!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh ooh, we have a live one!",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's a Macy's bag!",val
Rachel Green,Oh.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, who's it for?",val
Rachel Green,"""Dear losers, do you really think I'd hide presents under the couch? P.S.: Chandler, I knew they'd break you.""",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Rach, these are for you.",val
Rachel Green,Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do.",val
Chandler Bing,"OK, Pheebs, your turn.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Uh-huh.,val
Phoebe Buffay,You guuuyys.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth.",val
Ross Geller,You got me a cola drink?,val
Chandler Bing,"And, a lemon lime.",val
Ross Geller,"Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater.",val
Chandler Bing,And last but not least.,val
Joey Tribbiani,They're ribbed for *your* pleasure.,val
Ross Geller,"Ooh, hey Ben, what if the Holiday Armadillo told you all about the Festival of Lights?",val
Ross Geller,Yeah!,val
Monica Geller,Come on Ben.,val
Ross Geller,Years and years ago there were these people called the Maccabees...,val
Chandler Bing,"Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!",val
Chandler Bing,Hey!,val
Ross Geller,"What are you doing here, Santa?",val
Chandler Bing,"Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben. What are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?",val
Ross Geller,"I'm the Holiday Armadillo, your part-Jewish friend. You sent me here to give Ben some presents. Remember?",val
Chandler Bing,What?,val
Monica Geller,"Okay Ben, why don't you come open some more presents, and Santa, the Armadillo and I have a little talk in the kitchen? There's a sentence I'd never thought I'd say.",val
Ross Geller,What are you doing?,val
Chandler Bing,"You called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a Santa costume, so I borrowed one from a guy at work!",val
Ross Geller,"Thank you, but, but you, you gotta leave.",val
Chandler Bing,Why?,val
Ross Geller,"Because, I'm finally getting him excited about Hanukkah, and, and you're-you're wrecking it.",val
Chandler Bing,But I didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.,val
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me.",val
Chandler Bing,"Fine, I'll give the suit back.",val
Monica Geller,"Hey, you think, you can keep it another night?",val
Chandler Bing,Santa? Really?,val
Monica Geller,"Yeah, is that okay?",val
Chandler Bing,Did your Dad ever dress up like Santa?,val
Monica Geller,No.,val
Chandler Bing,Then it's okaaay!,val
Chandler Bing,"You know what, everybody? Go home. You should be with your families. It's bad enough that we're working New Year's Eve.",val
Chandler Bing,"Did I not tell *anyone* about New Year's Eve? -- Alright, look, go! Go home, okay? Merry Christmas! Go.",val
Chandler Bing,"Good, God's speed, good people! You're not gonna go?",val
Chandler Bing,Ah. Thanks.,val
Chandler Bing,Ah. Chandler Bing.,val
Monica Geller,Hi Honey! We're all here; we just want to wish you a Merry Christmas.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Ble-blah-blar Blargh!,val
Chandler Bing,"Ahh, Merry Christmas; I miss you guys!",val
Monica Geller,So is it horrible? Is everybody working really hard?,val
Chandler Bing,"Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy.",val
Monica Geller,Wendy? -- That sounds like a girl's name.,val
Chandler Bing,It is. Did I... not tell you about her?,val
Monica Geller,"Umhmm, umhmm, about the time you told me about New Year's Eve. Where is everybody else?",val
Chandler Bing,I sent them home.,val
Monica Geller,"Ohh, you are such a good boss! Is she pretty?",val
Chandler Bing,"Uhh, uh...",val
Ross Geller,"Answer faster, answer faster!",val
Chandler Bing,I don't know!,val
Ross Geller,"Answer better, answer better!",val
Chandler Bing,"I don't think of her that way, you know, she's a, she's a colleague.",val
Monica Geller,What does she do there?,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, she's regional Vice President; She's... just below me.",val
Monica Geller,She did WHAT?,val
Chandler Bing,BE-LOW me!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up Miss Oklahoma?",val
Monica Geller,*What*??,val
Chandler Bing,"Well, she... she didn't win...",val
Monica Geller,"Alright, well, maybe I should let you and the second prettiest girl in Oklahoma get back to work.",val
Chandler Bing,"Well, second prettiest that year; I mean, of *all* the girls in Oklahoma, she's probably...",val
Rachel Green,"Oh Chandler, stop talking!",val
Chandler Bing,"Honey, there's really nothing to worry about.",val
Monica Geller,Okay.,val
Chandler Bing,I'm serious!,val
Monica Geller,Okay!,val
Chandler Bing,Merry Christmas.,val
Monica Geller,Merry Christmas.,val
Chandler Bing,"Merry Christmas, you guys!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Blah blargah, blar-blab.",val
Chandler Bing,"The wife says ""Hi!"".",val
Chandler Bing,"Ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and I are alone, that something is gonna happen.",val
Chandler Bing,"This is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.",val
Chandler Bing,"Whoa-ho, back off, Missy!",val
Chandler Bing,I don't know; I'm not used to girls making passes at me! ... Wait a minute... am I sexy in Oklahoma?,val
Chandler Bing,"No,... no... NO! Look, I'm, I'm married!",val
Chandler Bing,I'm *happily* married.,val
Chandler Bing,"Right. So, I'm sorry...",val
Chandler Bing,"Well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. She's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... You know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. Look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. But, what I have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.",val
Chandler Bing,"I mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!",val
Monica Geller,Really?,val
Chandler Bing,You kidding? You're the most beautiful woman in most rooms... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? You and I just made out! You and I are making out?,val
Monica Geller,"Well, not anymore.",val
Chandler Bing,But we don't do that.,val
Monica Geller,"I know, I just thought it would be fun.",val
Chandler Bing,How drunk are you?,val
Monica Geller,Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this. Not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage.,val
Chandler Bing,That's the perfect amount!,val
Monica Geller,Okay!,val
Monica Geller,Y'know what's weird?,val
Chandler Bing,What?,val
Monica Geller,This doesn't feel weird!,val
Chandler Bing,I know.,val
Monica Geller,You're a really good kisser.,val
Chandler Bing,"Well, I have kissed over four women. Do you wanna get under the covers?",val
Monica Geller,Hm-hmm!,val
Chandler Bing,Okay!,val
Monica Geller,Wow! You are really fast!,val
Chandler Bing,It bodes well for me that speed impresses you.,val
Monica Geller,We're gonna see each other naked.,val
Chandler Bing,Yep!,val
Monica Geller,Do you wanna do it at the same time?,val
Chandler Bing,Count of three?,val
Monica Geller,One!,val
Chandler Bing,Two!,val
Monica Geller,Two!,val
Chandler Bing,Well I think it's safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined.,val
Monica Geller,"Eh, we weren't that close anyway!",val
Chandler Bing,Eh!,val
Chandler Bing,"So, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?",val
Monica Geller,"Well uh, you and I are just goofing around, I thought, why not just goof around with him.",val
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... Well, I have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. I am *so* bad at this.",val
Monica Geller,I think you're better than you think you are.,val
Chandler Bing,"Really? Okay, so...",val
Monica Geller,Know when to stop.,val
Chandler Bing,"Y'know, I sensed that I should stop. So we're okay?",val
Monica Geller,Yeah. Don't do the dance.,val
Chandler Bing,Right!,val
Monica Geller,"I can't get married until I get something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue.",val
Chandler Bing,"Okay, all right, all right, all right! Okay! Okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.",val
Monica Geller,You're so efficient. I love you!,val
Chandler Bing,Let's go!,val
Monica Geller,"No-no-no, wait! We need something old!",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, okay, I have condom in my wallet that I've had since I was twelve.",val
Monica Geller,That'll work!,val
Chandler Bing,I don't think so.,val
Monica Geller,"Okay, now we just need something borrowed!",val
Chandler Bing,Here just...take this.,val
Monica Geller,That's stealing!,val
Chandler Bing,"No, we'll-we'll bring it back! Just put it under your dress.",val
Monica Geller,Ohh.,val
Chandler Bing,"Okay, one thing at a time.",val
Monica Geller,"Listen umm, I've been thinking, it's not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.",val
Chandler Bing,Ehh.,val
Monica Geller,"Eh, you work for that.",val
Chandler Bing,"Look, I thought about it too, and I'm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.",val
Monica Geller,You do?!,val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I'm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.",val
Monica Geller,"Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?",val
Chandler Bing,"Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, y'know? We'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.",val
Monica Geller,You thought about that?,val
Chandler Bing,Yeah.,val
Monica Geller,How many kids were we gonna have?,val
Chandler Bing,"Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.",val
Monica Geller,What else did you think about?,val
Chandler Bing,"Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.",val
Monica Geller,"Y'know what? I-I don't want a big, fancy wedding.",val
Chandler Bing,Sure you do.,val
Monica Geller,"No, I want everything that you just said. I want a marriage.",val
Chandler Bing,You sure?,val
Monica Geller,Uh-hmm.,val
Chandler Bing,I love you so much.,val
Monica Geller,I love you.,val
Rachel Green,"Oohh, I love it!",val
Ross Geller,Really? You're not gonna return it?,val
Rachel Green,"Well, not this second!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey look, you guys, it's snowing!",val
Rachel Green,"Oh wow, it's so beautiful...",val
Ross Geller,"Wow, it really is!",val
Monica Geller,"""Wendy"" is a fat girl name.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Aren't we done with that?,val
Monica Geller,"Okay, fine. Let's talk about snow. -- Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband is having sex on a copying machine?",val
Chandler Bing,Hey!,val
Ross Geller,Oh my god...,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey-heeyyy - Look at that, it's a Christmas miracle!",val
Monica Geller,What are you doing here?,val
Chandler Bing,I wanted to be with you. I missed you so much.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey, uh, who did you miss the most?",val
Chandler Bing,Monica.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Got ya.,val
Chandler Bing,I never want to leave you again!,val
Monica Geller,"But I thought if you left, you get fired.",val
Chandler Bing,Turns out they can't fire me. Because I quit.,val
Monica Geller,What?,val
Ross Geller,"What, you, you really quit your job?",val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah! It's a stupid job, and I could not stand leaving you. And why should I be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?",val
Rachel Green,What do you really want to do?,val
Chandler Bing,I have *not* thought this through!,val
Monica Geller,Oh my god!,val
Chandler Bing,"I know, I, I should have talked to you first about it.",val
Monica Geller,"No, I think that this is what you wanna do, I think it's great!",val
Chandler Bing,Thanks!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined.",val
Chandler Bing,Ahh...,val
Phoebe Buffay,Now give me my real gift.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you.,val
Chandler Bing,"Here, pass these, will ya..",val
Ross Geller,"Oh, hey...",val
Ross Geller,"""A donation has been made in your name to the New York City Ballet."" -- How did you know?",val
Rachel Green,Wha... are you kidding? I can't return this.,val
Chandler Bing,"I... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. Besides, this gift still says I love you guys.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Mine's is to Lilian Myers.,val
Chandler Bing,I don't have a *job*! *Closing Credits*,val
Chandler Bing,"Actuary... no. Book-keeper... no. Topless dancer... Hey, d'you know what I just realized? You are the sole wage earner. *You* are the head of the household. I don't do anything - I'm a kept man!",val
Monica Geller,"You are! Hey, here's twenty bucks. -- Why don't you go buy yourself something pretty while I'm at work tomorrow?",val
Chandler Bing,Hey!,val
Monica Geller,"Good morning, Tiger! I'm making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight. You're gonna get me good and pregnant.",val
Chandler Bing,I've got nowhere to go this morning. I'm unemployed! I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.,val
Monica Geller,"Well, I just lost my erection.",val
Chandler Bing,"I mean, what am I supposed to do with myself?",val
Monica Geller,You're supposed to find your passion in life. You can be whatever you wanna be now. It's exciting.,val
Chandler Bing,But it's all so overwhelming. I don't know where to start.,val
Monica Geller,"Hey, wait a second. I can help you with this. You just need to be organized. We can make a list of your qualifications, and categorize jobs by industry. There could be folders and files!",val
Chandler Bing,Hey! This is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!,val
Monica Geller,I know!!! My erection is back!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Thank you!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Okay. Phoebe Thank you. Thank you!,val
Joey Tribbiani,": Pheebs, have you ever been bitten by a hungry Italian?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, it's just, I'm a little short on cash.",val
Joey Tribbiani,If you want I could loan you some money?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh no, no, no. I learned never to borrow money from friends. No, that's why Richard Dreyfuss and I don't speak anymore.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, hey, how about this? Wanna be an extra on my show?",val
Phoebe Buffay,You could do that?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah. The pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my god, I'm gonna be on TV!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, now. I gotta tell you, being on TV isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, really?",val
Joey Tribbiani,No it is awesome!,val
Ross Geller,Hi guys.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! Hey, why are you all dressed up?",val
Ross Geller,Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?,val
Joey Tribbiani,She sure does. Why does she have a pink bow taped to her head?,val
Rachel Green,"Well, because if one more person says ""what a cute little boy"" I'm gonna whip them with a car antenna!",val
Ross Geller,"I think she's gonna be the hit of the office, huh? She's gonna be hotter than peasant blouses and A-line skirts. Can I get a blue bow?",val
Monica Geller,"Okay, I have looked through a bunch of career guides, photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision.",val
Chandler Bing,How long was I in there?,val
Monica Geller,Okay. Let us start with the A's. Advertising.,val
Chandler Bing,Wait. Advertising! That's a great idea!,val
Monica Geller,Don't you want to look through the rest?,val
Chandler Bing,"I don't think I have to hear the rest. Advertising makes perfect sense. Sorry you had to waste all this time, though.",val
Monica Geller,"You call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time? Ooh, now I get to use my shredder!",val
Chandler Bing,"I mean, I can write slogans. I mean, how hard can it be, right? ""Cheese. It's milk that you chew."" ""Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy."" ""A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?""",val
Monica Geller,"I got one. ""Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best.""",val
Chandler Bing,Honey? Leave it to the pros.,val
Monica Geller,I actually know someone in advertising. I grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency. Maybe I can get him to meet you? Give me the phone.,val
Chandler Bing,"""The phone. Bringing you closer to people...who have phones.""",val
Monica Geller,"""Marriage. It's not for everybody.""",val
Rachel Green,That went well. Almost everybody knew that she was a girl.,val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, after you punched that one guy who got it wrong, word spread.",val
Rachel Green,I'm just gonna go in my office and pick up some stuff . Who the hell are you!?,val
Rachel Green,I'm the hell person whose office this is!,val
Ross Geller,"Good one, Rach.",val
Rachel Green,Excuse me?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes you are. I think it may be time for my sponge bath. Sorry, I'm just so used to hitting on the extras. So, are you excited about your scene?",val
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! But I'm a little shaky and nervous.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, now. What?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm just a little nervous.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, that helps.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too! Alright, eight.",val
Chandler Bing,"No, no. But let me show you what I can do. ""Bagels and donuts. Round food for every mood.""",val
Chandler Bing,Really? That's great!,val
Chandler Bing,"It's funny. When you said ""unpaid"" it sounded like you said ""unpaid.""",val
Chandler Bing,"Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight. Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now.",val
Rachel Green,"Wait a minute! What do you mean, you're taking over my job?",val
Rachel Green,A vacation? My idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw.,val
Rachel Green,"Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was. I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office.",val
Rachel Green,Excuse me?,val
Ross Geller,Rach we have a code brown situation.,val
Rachel Green,"Can you please, please take care of it for me?",val
Ross Geller,"Alright, but you have to do one sometime.",val
Rachel Green,Let me just get this straight! So I go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job?,val
Rachel Green,That's right. You're very cheeky for a temp.,val
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, what department was that? The Jerk department?",val
Rachel Green,Did they mention that I'm rubber and you're glue?,val
Rachel Green,"Oh, hi Mr. Zelner.",val
Rachel Green,"That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, wow. Super ass-kissing power.",val
Rachel Green,Today.,val
Rachel Green,"No, I said today! See, for a superhero, not so much with the listening.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey. So, what did he say?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, he can be a little rough around the edges, so I'm gonna replace a word he used a lot, with the word ""puppy."" Okay, So He Said ""If your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together, I'm gonna fire her mother-puppy ass.""",val
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, I can't do this. I'm not an actor.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Joey.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Who dies?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Man With Eye Patch! You get in there and you do your job.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, doctor.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Okay.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hang in there, Man With Eye Patch, your tray is coming!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, I did it!!! I nailed it!!! Yay! What's next?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, from the top, people!",val
Rachel Green,"Listen. Sudden change of plans. My maternity leave just ended. They told me that if I didn't come back today, they were gonna fire me.",val
Ross Geller,"What? No, that's illegal. I'm gonna have the labor department down her so fast they won't even...",val
Rachel Green,"Alright, alright. Calm down Norma Rae. They didn't actually say that. I'm just afraid if I don't come back right now this guy's gonna try to squeeze me out.",val
Ross Geller,What about Emma? We don't have a nanny.,val
Rachel Green,"I know. You know, we're just gonna have to figure out a plan tonight. Can you please just take care of her for today?",val
Ross Geller,Absolutely. Just give me your breast and we'll be on our way.,val
Rachel Green,"Come on, I don't know what else to do.",val
Ross Geller,"Fine, fine. We'll have fun, won't we? Yes, we will, yes we will.",val
Rachel Green,Ross?,val
Ross Geller,Huh?,val
Rachel Green,You're pretty.,val
Chandler Bing,"Whatever I decide to do, I'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. It's gonna be a while before I make a living at it. Maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.",val
Ross Geller,So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?,val
Chandler Bing,Yeah.,val
Ross Geller,Good-bye.,val
Monica Geller,"Okay, it's baby time. Pants off Bing. Didn't see you there Geller.",val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, Ross is here so...",val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, and I was really hoping that I could hang out. What do you feel like doing?",val
Monica Geller,We're gonna have sex.,val
Ross Geller,I don't feel like having sex. Maybe we can watch a movie or something.,val
Monica Geller,Let me put it this way. We're having sex whether you're here or not.,val
Ross Geller,Pants off Bing!,val
Rachel Green,"Alright. Now that I'm back, why don't you just fill me in on what you've been up to?",val
Rachel Green,"Hey, they were popular when I left!",val
Rachel Green,"Well, I should be involved in that, so why don't you get me up to speed?",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, no no no no. I see what you're doing here, alright, listen, this is my job buddy. Okay, I've had it for five years, and I know how it works, so why don't you just catch me up!",val
Rachel Green,Oh god. You've totally messed with the back support of my chair. How do you fix this?,val
Rachel Green,"Fine, I will. Alright, fill me in!",val
Ross Geller,Hey.,val
Chandler Bing,Hey.,val
Ross Geller,You have a blue tie that would go with this? Emma spit up on mine.,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah. But you have to give it back if I get a job. Of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.",val
Monica Geller,"Hi, good morning lover. I gotta say after last night, I'm a little weak in the knees.",val
Ross Geller,Here's an idea. You walk into a room...take a quick scan!,val
Monica Geller,Sorry. But I kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night.,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh god, I have to tell you something. You're not pregnant.",val
Monica Geller,What are you talking about?,val
Chandler Bing,That thing that I have to do to make a baby. I faked it.,val
Monica Geller,What!? You faked it?,val
Ross Geller,"You know what? I don't need a tie. I mean, it's better, open collar. You know, it's more casual.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, sometimes we use the same extras for different parts. It's okay.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it's not okay, because I gave a very memorable performance as the nurse. And now suddenly I'm the waitress? That's gonna confuse my fans.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Maybe you are a nurse, but you moonlight as a waitress.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Uhuh. Because I'm a single mother, supporting my two children.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Nice.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Wait a minute. Dr. Drake Ramoray and I work at the same hospital. Wouldn't I come over to say hi to him?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no. See, you and Drake are having a fight.",val
Phoebe Buffay,About what?,val
Joey Tribbiani,He slept with you and then never called you.,val
Phoebe Buffay,And I just wanted a new daddy for Davy and Becky.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, well, I'm very angry at him, because he slept with me and never called me back.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, calm down! She means on the show! We need some new extras around here!",val
Rachel Green,"Yes. Emma and I came in a little early to do research on the presentation. I actually made a few changes, but I think I'm caught up on everything. So ask me anything!",val
Rachel Green,"Except that! Oh, hello, Mr. Zelner. We're all ready for our presentation this afternoon.",val
Rachel Green,"What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour.",val
Rachel Green,"Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead, no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!",val
Rachel Green,"No, I can't, I have a baby.",val
Rachel Green,Why would you do that?,val
Rachel Green,That's really nice.,val
Rachel Green,"Then you're not gonna like what's coming. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Thank you, thank you.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Please don't fire my friend. Just let me talk to her.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, listen Pheebs. I was just talking to the director, and he was thinking, maybe this time you don't hit Drake, you just wait on the tables?",val
Phoebe Buffay,I can't do that. I'm an actor. I have a process.,val
Joey Tribbiani,You're a masseuse. You have a table with a hole in it.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Wait a minute, I see what's happening here. You're threatened.",val
Joey Tribbiani,What?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I'm so good in this scene that I'm stealing focus from you. Well, rise to the challenge Tribianni 'cause I just raised the bar. Come join me up here!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you can fire her, but I would call security, she won't go easy.",val
Monica Geller,You faked it? You couldn't have faked it!,val
Chandler Bing,Oh yes you can. You just make the faces and the noises.,val
Monica Geller,"Guys can fake it? Unbelievable. The one thing that's ours! Besides, why would you fake it when we're trying to have a baby?",val
Chandler Bing,"That's actually why. Look, I'm starting a whole new career now, and I'm not saying that I don't want to have a baby, I'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.",val
Monica Geller,Like a month?,val
Chandler Bing,Or a year?,val
Monica Geller,"Really, you want to wait a year?",val
Chandler Bing,"It could be less than a year. I mean, you've heard my stuff. ""Pants. Like shorts, but longer."" It'll probably be more than a year.",val
Monica Geller,I really wanna have a baby.,val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, me too. Look, I'll just get my old job back.",val
Monica Geller,"No, I want you to have a job that you love. Not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration.",val
Chandler Bing,I quit and you learn what I do?,val
Monica Geller,"It's just, I think, there's never gonna be a right time to have a baby. I mean, now you're unemployed and in a little while you'll find a new job that'll keep you really busy. There's always gonna be a reason not to do this, but I think once the baby comes, forget about all those reasons.",val
Chandler Bing,I guess. It's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.,val
Monica Geller,"It's gonna be really scary. I mean, god. When we have a baby, there's gonna be so much that we're not able to control. I mean, the apartment's gonna be a mess, I won't have time to clean it. What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer? Messes up all the ribbons?! What if there's no room for a ribbon drawer, because the baby's stuff takes up all the space!? Where will all the ribbons go!?!",val
Chandler Bing,Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind?,val
Monica Geller,"Yes, please!",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, and I promise, I will not fake it this time.",val
Monica Geller,I wish I could say the same. I'm a little shook up!,val
Phoebe Buffay,What about my children Drake?! Huh!? No!! No!! No! God!,val
Chandler Bing,Hey.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey. So where's Mon?,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight.",val
Joey Tribbiani,And you're not helping?,val
Chandler Bing,"I tried, but apparantly singing ""I will survive"" in a helium voice - not helping.",val
Ross Geller,Hey you guys!,val
Rachel Green,"Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me.",val
Ross Geller,"Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly . Molly, Chandler, Joey.",val
Ross Geller,"Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"You damn right I am, I've been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes.",val
Rachel Green,"Ok, you know what, I'm just gonna take her outside.",val
Rachel Green,"OK, thank you.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you too.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, wow, Molly is just great!",val
Ross Geller,Yeah.,val
Chandler Bing,"Yes, Bravo on the hot nanny.",val
Rachel Green,What? You really think she's hot?,val
Chandler Bing,Are you kidding? If I wasn't married she'd be rejecting me right now.,val
Rachel Green,And Joey?,val
Joey Tribbiani,How do you think she's doing?,val
Rachel Green,Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?,val
Ross Geller,"Eh, I mean, I mena she's not unattractive but hot? I ....",val
Rachel Green,Thank you!,val
Chandler Bing,Now that Rachel's gone?,val
Rachel Green,So hot I cried myself to sleep last night.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey Mike, what's the capital of Peru?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"No. It starts with a ""v"" and ends with an ""x"". Helpfully with a ""to"" in the middle.",val
Phoebe Buffay,What?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, whew, no, that's Bob.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn't poop on the plate of cookies.",val
Phoebe Buffay,What are those?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"So weird, you think he's so gross and you're willing to eat his crackers.",val
Rachel Green,Hello.,val
Rachel Green,"Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology.",val
Rachel Green,"Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious ...",val
Rachel Green,"No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don't mean anything. And I-I think you're a really good guy and I'm sorry that I misjudged you.",val
Rachel Green,"Hello. But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, I am just really really happy ... I'm sorry, obviously Heather's ass has something more important to say so I'll just wait 'till it's finished.",val
Rachel Green,I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out!,val
Rachel Green,"Oh wow, you are really, you're really a creep.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah, I'm jealous. ""Oh Gavin, please, please look at my ass"". Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she's your subordinate.",val
Rachel Green,"That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn't know that you knew that. And two, I wasn't some creep staring at his ass, we had a deap meaningful relationship.",val
Rachel Green,"It was ... oh my god. He didn't have a last name. It was just ""Tag"". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag's last name was Morgan! Huh!",val
Rachel Green,"Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Sure.,val
Monica Geller,Would you stop staring at her?,val
Chandler Bing,I wasn't staring. I was leering.,val
Monica Geller,What's the big deal with her? Maybe she's attractive in an obvious kind of way.,val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst. You know, when it's right there in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me feel like I earned it.",val
Chandler Bing,Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.,val
Monica Geller,"Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl for once.",val
Ross Geller,"Ok, I'll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I love you - wovyou dovyou ...",val
Monica Geller,They've elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it's not so good.,val
Rachel Green,"Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if you didn't go after her.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Why not?,val
Rachel Green,"Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn't want anything to, you know, drive her away.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"So, what, you think I'm just gonna sleep with her and never call her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? Yeah, sounds about right.",val
Ross Geller,"Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just forget about her, ok? Just, she's off limits.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told me I can't have it makes me want her even more!",val
Ross Geller,"What are you, a child?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Yes!,val
Ross Geller,"Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Fine.,val
Monica Geller,Take me home!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Hey Mikey.,val
Phoebe Buffay,What are you doing?,val
Phoebe Buffay,To kill Bob??,val
Phoebe Buffay,"No, Mike, I don't want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? Bob! Robert! Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob had babies! Bob's a mom!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my god, we killed Bob!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Suzie?,val
Ross Geller,Whazzup??,val
Chandler Bing,"Seriously dude, 3 years ago.",val
Ross Geller,"Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?",val
Chandler Bing,You don't trust him?,val
Ross Geller,"Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier and asked for her daughter, the ""hot nanny"".",val
Chandler Bing,"Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? Because I could get a job any day now.",val
Ross Geller,"You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I'm sure he'll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do this for me?",val
Chandler Bing,"Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not, he's going to have sex with it.",val
Ross Geller,"Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don't grow on trees.",val
Chandler Bing,Picturing that tree?,val
Ross Geller,"I am, yes.",val
Chandler Bing,"Where you going, Joe?",val
Joey Tribbiani,For a walk.,val
Chandler Bing,Oh. You mind if I join you?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize my thoughts.",val
Chandler Bing,Your thoughts? Plural?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It's about the hot nanny, I gotta see her!",val
Chandler Bing,"I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me! She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over there?",val
Chandler Bing,"Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can't let you go.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.,val
Chandler Bing,Great novels?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Fine ... mediocre porn.,val
Rachel Green,"Rachel Green's office!! Give me that phone! Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I'll pass you back to your son.",val
Rachel Green,"Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.",val
Rachel Green,If you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror?,val
Rachel Green,"Oh, please, I don't care about you enough to bug me. In fact, from now on, I'm going take the high road. And I'm going be very very nice to you, you ""momma's boy"", starting right now.",val
Monica Geller,Hey Rach!,val
Rachel Green,Hi!,val
Monica Geller,Ready for your birthday lunch?,val
Rachel Green,"Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin Mitchelle.",val
Monica Geller,Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?,val
Rachel Green,"Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his mother.",val
Rachel Green,Why did you invite him?? I can't stand that guy!,val
Monica Geller,You were just being so nice to him!,val
Rachel Green,I was faking it! Can't you tell when I'm being fake?,val
Rachel Green,"Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!",val
Monica Geller,Right there! That was so fake!,val
Rachel Green,Shh!,val
Rachel Green,"I still can't believe you invited Gavin. Allright, he is the last person I want to see.",val
Monica Geller,"Oh, you're welcome for the party. I'm glad you're having a good time.",val
Rachel Green,"God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.",val
Monica Geller,Does he?,val
Rachel Green,What?,val
Monica Geller,Maybe he's bothering you so much because he likes you. It's like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me?,val
Rachel Green,"Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, ok, thank you. Do you see what all the guys see in her?",val
Monica Geller,Wouldn't kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Rach, so can I sing happy birthday to you now?",val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, sure!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh ... Happy birth ... oh, see you later.",val
Monica Geller,"Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, give me!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!",val
Rachel Green,"Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?",val
Monica Geller,So this is what a stroke feels like.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're a mother.",val
Rachel Green,Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed them.",val
Rachel Green,"whhh wait, you're gonna leave my party to take care of a box of rats?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone can afford help.",val
Ross Geller,Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.,val
Chandler Bing,"I'm sorry, I got a little occupied.",val
Ross Geller,We have to stop them before something happens!,val
Chandler Bing,"Right behind you, big guy!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I didn't go to college.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Molly ... people don't study acting ...,val
Ross Geller,"Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?",val
Ross Geller,Thanx.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Will the stable boy never get the princess??,val
Ross Geller,"What do you think you're gonna do, have sex with her right here on my couch?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn't fair. What makes you think that I'm just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? Huh? Can't you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, and might want something real? Look, the truth is, I haven't felt this way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn't think I could ever love again.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Ok.,val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, come on in. Molly?",val
Ross Geller,"Ok ... Well, uh, Joey, I guess we have no problem.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"It's like my favorite fairy tale come true! The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, you know what, they're our responsibility now.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"No. wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then each of those have 7 rats? That's like ... That's math I can't even do! What are we gonna do?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's favorites.",val
Phoebe Buffay,You must think I'm crazy.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Good. It's just so hard, it's hard for me to ... let them go. I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to my brother's triplets and I had to give them up. I haven't told you about that yet, have I?",val
Monica Geller,Hey!,val
Rachel Green,"Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?",val
Monica Geller,"No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?",val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday's over.",val
Monica Geller,"Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from your office didn't show up .",val
Rachel Green,Mmm hmm.,val
Monica Geller,"Oh, we weren't talking about you. No, no way to recover.",val
Rachel Green,No.,val
Rachel Green,"Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn't showed up at ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ...",val
Monica Geller,"Again, you're welcome.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, you bought me a present! Why?",val
Rachel Green,"Aww. Well, ok, well that's very nice. And you wrote a card . ""From Gavin""",val
Rachel Green,"Awww, awww, it's beautiful.",val
Rachel Green,"See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such a hard time?",val
Rachel Green,Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.,val
Rachel Green,You do?,val
Rachel Green,"See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion of you, you go and you ... and you do that ...",val
Chandler Bing,"First I was afraid, I was petrified.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.,val
Chandler Bing,Hi.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Listen, I think I've left something here.",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, well someone left this . This is yours?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"No, but I like it. I think I left one of my rat babies.",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, uh, well, I haven't seem it but if I do I'll let you know.",val
Monica Geller,Ohmygod! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, maybe that's him!",val
Chandler Bing,Hey!,val
Ross Geller,Yeah! Yeah! OK! Sure! Look! Can we...can we talk about what happened here last night?,val
Chandler Bing,Sure! Just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! Do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...I mean come on!!,val
Ross Geller,OK you...you really don't know what I am talking about?,val
Chandler Bing,No!,val
Ross Geller,OK! Last night after the party I saw Rachel kissing that jerk from her office out on your balcony.,val
Chandler Bing,"Our balcony? Seriously? That's so funny because I told Monica we should put lights on our balcony. And she said""No, no. It's too cold, nobody will go out there."" And I said ""Maybe if we put some light out there they will""",val
Ross Geller,"Right that's why I came over to talk about. Hum...I saw Rachel kissing some guy on your balcony,even though there were NO LIGHTS !",val
Chandler Bing,So are you gonna...talk to her?,val
Ross Geller,"Why...Why should I? I mean if she wants to move on, that's fine!",val
Chandler Bing,"You know when ""That's fine"" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!",val
Ross Geller,"No I'm serious. I mean she wants to date people? Fine! I don't care but...at least she could have told me. You knowI...I've been putting my life on hold and just concentrating on Emma but if she wants to go out there kissing guys shebarely knows, then so will I ! Very funny! Ross is gay! Ah! Ah!",val
Chandler Bing,No no no. Good. So you're moving on? Do you have any idea where you're moving?,val
Ross Geller,"I don't know. I mean I have plenty of opportunity. Just just now there were some women at the coffee house smiled at me.And then the other day on the subway a woman ""accidentally"" sat on my hand.",val
Chandler Bing,"Dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!",val
Ross Geller,"Well, and how about this? There is an anthropologist at school who totally came on to me during the inter-departmentalPotluck dinner.",val
Chandler Bing,Why did I get married?!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! Let me ask you guys something. I have a new headshot taken tomorrow right and the photographer said she thinks Ishould have my eyebrows waxed. Is that weird for a guy?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Well it depends.,val
Joey Tribbiani,On...?,val
Phoebe Buffay,On how far along he's in the sex change process!,val
Monica Geller,"No I totally disagree. No I think it's fine for a guy to do something like that. Such you an actor. Not that you need to,your eyebrows are...",val
Joey Tribbiani,Ok! Stop it you guys! Stop staring! You're freaking me out!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Your knuckles are kinda hairy too...,val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh man! I have to get those done too?!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Wow! Talking about high maintenance.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey hey! You dye your hair!,val
Phoebe Buffay,I'm a woman!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Arghhh! Double standards!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh before I forget, are you coming to Mike's piano bar tonight?",val
Monica Geller,Only if I don't have to get up and sing.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"But everybody sings. It's so much fun! Last time this adorable old man got out there, forgot all of the words, flipped outand everyone booed him off the stage. So funny.",val
Monica Geller,"It's just, I'm not good at singing.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! What's the matter? Are you scared? You're afraid I'm a better singer? You're afraid I'm gonna beat you at singing?,val
Monica Geller,"No no, it's not working on me. Wow! I must be growing up!",val
Phoebe Buffay,OK fine! Please come and support Mike. You don't have to sing.,val
Monica Geller,So I don't have to sing and I can just sit there and pass judgments on others?,val
Phoebe Buffay,While drinking...,val
Monica Geller,I'm there!,val
Rachel Green,Hi guys! Listen I really need your help. I think I did something really stupid.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Well yes Rachel but you got something so beautiful out there.,val
Rachel Green,No not that. I kissed Gavin last night.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my god.,val
Monica Geller,You kissed him?,val
Rachel Green,"Yeah. It was after the party, we were on the balcony and...",val
Monica Geller,Wait wait wait. I was at home the whole time. How did I missed that?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"It was the end of the party, you were probably ironing wrapping paper.",val
Monica Geller,Oh yeah...So how did you end up kissing?,val
Rachel Green,"You know we were all alone and he was being really nice to me and, oh and he gave me this scarf...",val
Monica Geller,I thought you hated him?,val
Rachel Green,"You know honey, there is a thin line between love and hate, and it turns out that line...is a scarf!",val
Monica Geller,So are you thinking of starting up something with this guy?,val
Rachel Green,"I don't know. It's so complicated. I work with this guy, you know, I have the baby, and I have Ross, and I just...I don'tknow what to do and I have to be at the office and see Gavin in ten minutes.",val
Monica Geller,"Sounds like you need to think about what you want, talk to Gavin, and you definitely should talk to Ross.",val
Rachel Green,Or...I could call in sick and not deal with it at all...,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow! Five-month maternity leave, you're back for four days, kiss a co-worker, call in sick, they are lucky to have you!!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey. I'm here for my eyebrow appointment.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler Bing.,val
Joey Tribbiani,OK Thanks.. I touched the stuff.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks. Do you get a lot of guys in here?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh good...,val
Joey Tribbiani,All right let's just do this.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Please I have an extremely high threshold...Holly Mother Of God! My face! My face!! I'm all right! I'm all right!Just a little bit of shock that's all but I'll be fine you can go again. I'm OK Dammit! Woman!! How Hoooow!,val
Chandler Bing,Hey it's the most eligible man in NY. How's the moving on going?,val
Ross Geller,Not well. I went on the subway again and someone did sit on my hand but that person was neither female nor wearing pants.,val
Chandler Bing,"Well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. You know I mean think about it. Single white male, divorced three times,two illegitimate children. The personal ad writes itself....",val
Ross Geller,That's funny...Do you think you'll ever work again?,val
Chandler Bing,What are doing? You know I can only dish it out!,val
Ross Geller,I can't believe Rachel just moved on and didn't say anything to me.,val
Chandler Bing,"Maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing.",val
Ross Geller,"No no, about a month ago she gave her number to some guy in a bar.",val
Chandler Bing,Did she go out with him?,val
Ross Geller,"No. When he called, I...I threw the message away.",val
Chandler Bing,Ah! The high road...,val
Ross Geller,You know what? Enough! Enough talking! I have to get moving! Hey check out those two blondes over there!Hey come with me!,val
Chandler Bing,Are you trying to get everybody divorced?,val
Ross Geller,"You don't have to do anything. It will just be easier if it is the two of us, like college, remember? You...you break theice with some kind of jokes so that they know you're the funny one and I swoop in with some interesting conversation, sothey'll see that I'm the brilliant, brooding, sexy one...",val
Chandler Bing,I thought I had to make the jokes!,val
Ross Geller,Don't you have to be at work?,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh come on! Hello! Hi! My name is Chandler, here's my friend Ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. We only need six more people for a human pyramid...Swoop!! Swoop!!",val
Ross Geller,"Hum...So...hum...Oh hey I noticed you were reading the paper...another flood in Europe? Here's a question: ""Would you...would you rather drown or be burnt alive?""",val
Chandler Bing,We still got it!,val
Rachel Green,Who is it?,val
Rachel Green,Why?,val
Rachel Green,"Oh! Right! Yeah! Hold on, I'll be just clean up in here a little bit! Hello Gavin.",val
Rachel Green,"I a not gonna lie to you, I'm pretty sick.",val
Rachel Green,Oh no no no.,val
Rachel Green,So did I.,val
Rachel Green,It's just a cold.,val
Rachel Green,What? What's the matter?,val
Rachel Green,Oh he's dusting me with a fossil brush. He thought it would be funny.,val
Rachel Green,"Oh you're not. You're not gonna get in the middle of anything, don't worry about Ross really, really. Oh! Hide! That's Ross! Hide! Hide!",val
Rachel Green,I lied! And I'm not sick! Just stay behind the curtain!,val
Rachel Green,Oh! Molly! You're not Ross.,val
Rachel Green,"Right, right, yes!",val
Rachel Green,What?,val
Rachel Green,No! That's OK! That's OK! That's OK! No no no no! This is my business associate Gavin. He's just being silly.Gavin come out from behind that curtain!,val
Rachel Green,OK.,val
Rachel Green,I thought it was Ross.,val
Rachel Green,There isn't. There is totally isn't.,val
Rachel Green,"All right. Look. Gavin...I...I guess I felt guilty that you were here, which I shouldn't. You know Ross and I are not inany relationship but...he is the father of my child, and you know we do live together and plus there is just so muchhistory...you know it's just...I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm just all over the place.",val
Rachel Green,Yes.,val
Rachel Green,People keep saying that. Oh I'm sorry Gavin.,val
Rachel Green,So seriously...rodeo clown?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"""No time for losers, 'cause we are the champions of the world...!"" Thank you!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Hi hi...Oh you have got to sing.,val
Monica Geller,No I told you I can't.,val
Phoebe Buffay,But you would have so much fun and you have a really nice voice.,val
Monica Geller,What have you heard me sing?,val
Phoebe Buffay,All the time when you're cooking.,val
Monica Geller,What?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah you're always singing ""Yummy yummy yummy, I've got love in my tummy""",val
Monica Geller,Yeah I do rock that one.,val
Phoebe Buffay,OK so isn't there a little part of you that wants to get up there?,val
Monica Geller,Just a little but...it's just so scary! I don't even know what I would sing...,val
Monica Geller,"""Delta Dawn""",val
Ross Geller,"Hi! I could help not notice, but that's an unusual necklace.",val
Ross Geller,"Right, so that's a firm ""no"". I cannot believe this, I just keep striking out.",val
Chandler Bing,"I don't get it neither, I mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed.",val
Ross Geller,This is great. Rachel's gonna keep kissing guys until she finds the one she wants and I'm gonna die alone.,val
Chandler Bing,By drowning or...?!,val
Chandler Bing,Well...,val
Ross Geller,I know!,val
Monica Geller,Wait wait! I can't sing in front of all these people.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Just pretend they're not even here! It's OK Monica, when that spotlight hits you it so bright you won't see anyoneanyway.",val
Monica Geller,"Hi! I'm Monica and I'm gonna be singing ""Delta Dawn""""Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on? Could it be a faded rose from days gone by? ...""",val
Phoebe Buffay,Can you totally see through her shirt ?,val
Monica Geller,"""To take you to his mansion in the sky-y?""",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I need your help.",val
Chandler Bing,"Wow, it seems serious. What seems to be the problem, Ashley Judd?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, I'll get new headshot taken, all right, so I want to get my eyebrows shaped.",val
Chandler Bing,"I am sorry, moment to make fun of that, please!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"You may be a sissy but I'll still . All right, it hurts so bad, I could only let her do oneeyebrow and now... they don't match!",val
Chandler Bing,It's like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, look, you got to help me out, ok? Look, I have the magic marker, I want you to fill in the skinny one soI don't look stupid for my pictures.",val
Chandler Bing,"Ok. First of all, this is green!",val
Joey Tribbiani,What the hell am I supposed to do!,val
Chandler Bing,"All right, I will help you out but you have to promise me you will not tell anyone what I am about to tell you.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"What, what.",val
Chandler Bing,"Ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well I earned mineby plucking the eyebrows of my father and his ""business"" partners.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my God!,val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well, I guess you don't need my help Victor Victoria!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok all right, no, no, no, no, I do, I do, I do, I need your help, but Chandler I don't know if I can take anymoreplucking. It hurts so bad!",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe Vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.",val
Monica Geller,"""Take me to the mansion in the sky-y"". I am sorry, the song is over. Did you see me out there?",val
Phoebe Buffay,Every little bit of you!,val
Monica Geller,"I can't believe I did this. I can't believe I'm singing for the people, and they liked me! Hey, did you hear thatone shouting ""look at those tips""! I mean, did I really help you get a lot of tips?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Mon', not that you didn't sound good, but...",val
Monica Geller,Good? Didn't you hear them...I was great! Thank you so much for making me do this. That's is the best gift ever.,val
Ross Geller,"But, what's great is that you don't mind talking about it.",val
Ross Geller,Uh-ah!,val
Ross Geller,. Good choice Ross.,val
Rachel Green,"Oh, hey! Hi, there you are, I've been looking for you everywhere!",val
Ross Geller,"Oh, yeah, hello, well, now, here I am.",val

Ross Geller,"Oh, yeah, yeah that's Michelle.",val
Rachel Green,Who?,val
Ross Geller,"Oh, just this woman I've been seeing.",val
Rachel Green,You've being seeing someone?,val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, didn't I mention that? Yeah, I mean, we haven't being going out for too long, but rather there is thisamazing connection between us. I-I mean, in fact just before you came in she called me her boyfriend. I thought it wasa little too soon, but it was also, you know, it was kinda nice.",val
Ross Geller,"How great is this? You are already comfortable enough to look through my stuff. Oh, I am sorry Michelle, that'smy roommate, Rachel.",val
Rachel Green,"Hi, and I am also Emma's mother.",val
Ross Geller,I told you about my daughter.,val

Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah. Hey, they totally match! They look great! They look great! How you doing!",val

Joey Tribbiani,Thank you so much.,val
Chandler Bing,No problem.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Listen that's a pretty girly hour we just spent, we should add some manly make up for it.",val
Chandler Bing,Yeah.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Comb my eyelashes.,val
Monica Geller,"Ok, for my next song I think I'll sing something a little more upbeat. All right? Oh, how about the PointerSisters ""I am so excited"". And make it bouncy!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh you'll probably take care of that on your hands.,val
Chandler Bing,I am sorry I am late. You'll understand when you'll see Joey.,val
Monica Geller,"Honey, you're just in time, I'm about to sing another song!",val
Chandler Bing,Really? In front of all this people?,val

Ross Geller,"I told you it wasn't long, but there is an amazing connection between us.",val
Ross Geller,Are you kidding?,val
Ross Geller,We'll see.,val
Rachel Green,"Ok, Ross, what's going on here, are we just bringing strange women back to the apartment now?",val
Ross Geller,"I don't know, are we just kissing guys on balconies?",val
Rachel Green,How do you know about that?,val
Ross Geller,"Through the magic of sight! I was here, putting our child to sleep...",val
Ross Geller,"When I happened to look through the window and I see you kissing a guy you know, for what? A week?",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, that's what this is all about? Did you bring her up here to get back at me?",val
Ross Geller,"Ok, Michelle, it's time to go.",val
Ross Geller,Ok.,val
Ross Geller,"You know, if it's meant to be, I'll guess it. Bye, bye.",val
Rachel Green,Score.,val
Ross Geller,"Oh, I am sorry, did you not like her, because I was hoping that we could come to one of your kissing parties onthe balcony.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh God, I can't believe you're making such a big deal about this. It was one kiss, one guy, one time!",val
Ross Geller,"Oh, really!",val
Rachel Green,Yeah.,val
Ross Geller,"Oh, really!",val
Rachel Green,Oh yeah.,val
Ross Geller,What about the guy from the bar?,val
Rachel Green,What? Who?,val
Ross Geller,The guy you gave your number to.,val
Rachel Green,"Whoa, how do you know about that?",val
Ross Geller,"Because he called here looking for you. So don't tell me this...this kissing this guy from work is a one time thing,ok? You've been out there in bars and on balconies for over a month now. And you didn't even have the courtesy to tell me.",val
Rachel Green,Why didn't I get that message?,val
Ross Geller,What?,val
Rachel Green,"From the guy in the bar, why didn't I get that message?",val
Ross Geller,Because I folded it up and put in my pants pocket. Do you...do you not look there?,val
Rachel Green,Ross?,val
Ross Geller,I never gave it to you.,val
Rachel Green,Why?,val
Ross Geller,I don't know.,val
Rachel Green,Oh God. You know what? Who you think you are? Who are you to decide what messages I should or should not get?,val
Ross Geller,Who am I?,val
Rachel Green,Yes.,val
Ross Geller,I am the guy who's taking care of our baby while you're out at bars meeting guys!,val
Rachel Green,"Oh my God, I cannot believe this. You know I actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with youAbout us! But I can't do that with someone who hides my messages and brings crazy women back to my apartment!",val
Ross Geller,None of the sane ones wanted to come back with me! That's not the point. Ok? The point is you...you are the oneWho moved on and didn't tell anyone!,val
Rachel Green,"Oh, Ross, this is just so messed up! What's wrong with us? You know when people hear about our situation theyAlways ask, ""what, you live together but you're not a couple? And you have a baby, isn't that weird? And I say ""No.You know what, it's not, because it works for us! But you know this doesn't work. In fact this is the opposite of working!",val
Ross Geller,"Uh, clearly.",val
Rachel Green,"And you know, we said that we would, we would live together as long as this makes sense. An maybe this, you know,Just doesn't make sense anymore.",val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, maybe not. So what you wanna do?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,val
Rachel Green,Hi. Can Emma and I live here for a while?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ha, oh, of course.",val
Rachel Green,Thank you.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Your eyebrows look weird.,val
Chandler Bing,"""Jeremiah was a bullfrog. Was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but I helped himdrink his wine."" So you just touch yourself for anything?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Morning, roomie!",val
Rachel Green,Hey! You remembered to put clothes on this morning.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Fifth day's a charm.,val
Rachel Green,"Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're making it so easy on me and Emma.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, it's great having you back. You know, stay as long as you want, and when does she stop crying all night?",val
Ross Geller,"Hey, you're not naked! So hey, Rach, when will we expect to see you tonight?",val
Rachel Green,"Well, I'll probably be back to pick her up around six, but she's in the bedroom all ready to go. But she did actually fall back to sleep, so...",val
Joey Tribbiani,She's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night.,val
Rachel Green,Bye!,val
Ross Geller,"Bye! Hey, I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, hey, it's been great.",val
Ross Geller,Yeah?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay? And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump...",val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, that'll do it.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow! So, how are you?",val
Ross Geller,"I'm, I'm okay.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Really?,val
Ross Geller,"Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's a divorce.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, actually it...",val
Ross Geller,"No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing other people.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Wow, really?",val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, sure, why not? In fact, if you know anyone that would be good for me...",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure, I know lots of girls.",val
Ross Geller,Yeah? Any names come to mind?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, names? Opening credits.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Hey.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey. I was just gonna get something to eat. You want something?,val
Phoebe Buffay,What you got?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, let's see, we got strained peas, strained carrots... Ooh! Strained plums. We haven't tried that yet.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart from the great food.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Why are they doing this?,val
Phoebe Buffay,I don't know. They're so perfect for each other; it's crazy.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"You know what's crazy? These jars. What is it, like two bites in here?",val
Phoebe Buffay,I just wish they'd realise they should be together.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, I know. And when they moved back in together, I figured y'know, that's where things were headed.",val
Phoebe Buffay,I know. They should be a family. They should get married and have more children.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes, and they should name one of their kids Joey. I may not have kids; someone's gotta carry on the family name.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"You know what? Maybe once they start dating, and they see what's out there, they'll realise how good they are for each other.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, because it is slim pickings. I had this date last night: Yuck! But we should probably keep it down; she's still in the bedroom.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"So, what are we gonna do? Are we just gonna go ahead and set them up with people?",val
Joey Tribbiani,I know; that just pushes them further and further apart.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah. Oh, I know what we can do. We could set Ross and Rachel up on horrible dates, so that they'll realise how good they are together.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, that's a great plan!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, you know what the best part of it is? I get to do my ""plan-laugh.""",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Shhh! Not so loud, we don't wanna wake up, uh...",val
Rachel Green,Hey!,val
Monica Geller,Hey!,val
Rachel Green,"You guys aren't doing anything tonight, are you?",val
Chandler Bing,"See, now, why would you assume that? Just because we're married? I will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to reading the obituaries.",val
Rachel Green,I was just asking 'cause I need someone to watch Emma tonight.,val
Monica Geller,"Sure, we'll do that. What are you up to?",val
Rachel Green,"Well, Phoebe set me up on a date.",val
Monica Geller,Oh my god.,val
Chandler Bing,Wow.,val
Rachel Green,Why? What's the big deal?,val
Monica Geller,"Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are...",val
Rachel Green,"What, slept together a year and a half ago? Yeah, I'm all set.",val
Chandler Bing,"Well, I think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? I mean, it sounds healthy. I mean, you have needs. Embrace your womanhood!",val
Monica Geller,"You want a job? Turn off ""Oprah,"" and send out a resume!",val
Rachel Green,So I'll bring her by around seven? Is that okay?,val
Monica Geller,"Oh, it's perfect.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, you guys are gonna have so much fun! She's at such a cute age. Oh, a couple things. Now that she's eating solid food, she poops around the clock. And watch out for your hair, 'cause she likes to grab it. And oh, she's also in this phase where if you leave the room, she screams bloody murder, but ah... Thanks, you guys. Have fun!",val
Chandler Bing,Suddenly I wish I was reading my own name.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, Joey.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Hey. I'm so excited; I just set up Rachel with the worst guy tonight.,val
Joey Tribbiani,All right! Who is he?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it's this guy I used to massage. And by massage, I mean hold down so he wouldn't turn over and flash me.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Okay, okay. Wait till you hear who I got for Ross.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah.",val
Joey Tribbiani,She's this really boring woman. She's a teacher!,val
Phoebe Buffay,A teacher?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah, she's really into history and foreign movies... And oh, oh, she loves puzzles. Huh? Come on, who loves puzzles?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, Ross does. What... You're - you're ruining the plan! Joey, you've - you've fixed him up with his perfect woman!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my god, you're right!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.,val
Joey Tribbiani,She even reads for pleasure!,val
Phoebe Buffay,How do you even know a woman like that?,val
Joey Tribbiani,What? I'm not allowed to know smart women?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Joey.,val
Joey Tribbiani,I met her at the library. I went in to pee.,val
Phoebe Buffay,So now what do we do?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, okay, I'll - I'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled, and find him somebody else.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh...I hear that's bad.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, yes, The Plan!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"It's not Santa's plan. No, it's...",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, you know, it's not that fun.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I think we killed it.",val
Chandler Bing,"Emma? Emma? Look at me! Well, I think I'll go downstairs for a while.",val
Chandler Bing,"No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go. Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler; funny is all I have!",val
Monica Geller,"Okay, just so you know, I'm gonna be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth, so don't touch yourself in the next 48 hours.",val
Chandler Bing,I don't do that.,val
Chandler Bing,"I'll try to stop. Wait, did you say until the sixth?",val
Monica Geller,Yeah.,val
Chandler Bing,Today is the sixth.,val
Monica Geller,"No, it's not.",val
Chandler Bing,"Yes, it's also 2003.",val
Monica Geller,Oh my god. Today's the sixth?! I may be done ovulating! I may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant.,val
Chandler Bing,It's okay. Go take the test and see if we're okay.,val
Monica Geller,Okay.,val
Chandler Bing,Tough crib.,val
Monica Geller,"Hey, where are all my ovulation-sticks? There's only one here.",val
Chandler Bing,I might have checked to see if I was ovulating a couple times.,val
Monica Geller,Chandler!,val
Chandler Bing,I am not working. There's not much to do around here!,val
Ross Geller,"Excuse me, is there a woman waiting at the bar? Someone average height, dark hair, perhaps doing a puzzle?",val
Ross Geller,"Well, if I'm still here in an hour, buy him a drink on me.",val
Ross Geller,"Nah, I don't know if I should. I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone.",val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it's no big deal. It's just a blind date.",val
Ross Geller,No!,val
Monica Geller,We're okay. I'm still ovulating.,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, I am not.",val
Monica Geller,"So, let's do this.",val
Chandler Bing,I - I don't think I can.,val
Monica Geller,"Come on. I know you're not eighteen anymore, but give it a minute.",val
Chandler Bing,Because of Emma.,val
Monica Geller,"Oh my god, Emma. Oh, sweetie, I forgot you were here. Oh, you're right, we can't do this. We can't leave her alone.",val
Chandler Bing,Sorry.,val
Monica Geller,"Unless... Maybe we do it here. I mean, how much can she even be aware of at this age?",val
Chandler Bing,"Well, she's aware when we leave the room. She may notice if we start... canoodling in it.",val
Monica Geller,Canoodling?,val
Chandler Bing,"Well, I can't say ""hump"" or ""screw"" in front of the B-A-B-Y.",val
Monica Geller,"I don't know. I mean, I guess having sex in front of a baby isn't so...",val
Chandler Bing,Horrifying? Scarring? Something people go to jail for?,val
Monica Geller,I guess you're right.,val
Chandler Bing,"You guess I'm right? When we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window.",val
Monica Geller,But what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer?,val
Rachel Green,"Wow, everything looks so good! I think I'm gonna have the chicken.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, well, that's - that's very sweet. Thank you.",val
Rachel Green,What?,val
Rachel Green,"So, what do think you wanna order? I'm really excited about that chicken.",val
Rachel Green,"Well, come on, Steve; let's not rule out nervous laughter. Hey, now wait a minute. Phoebe told me that - that you owned your own restaurant. That's impressive.",val
Rachel Green,Really? What's that like?,val
Rachel Green,"Now, come on, come on, Steve. There must be something that you like about yourself.",val
Rachel Green,Really?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Hello?,val
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, Rach!",val
Rachel Green,This is the worst date ever. How could you set me up with this creep?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, you are talking about one of my dear, dear friends.",val
Rachel Green,I don't care! This guy is a nightmare!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, right, so he gets a little crazy when he's stoned.",val
Rachel Green,He's not stoned.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Did he go out for a cigarette?,val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, four times.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"My dear, sweet Rach.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, our plan is working. Rachel is having a miserable time, and Ross is just stood up somewhere at a restaurant all alone.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, great, pretty soon they'll be back together.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"By the time anyone's figured out what we've done, we'll be in sunny Mexico. Oh, wait, that's the end of a different plan.",val
Monica Geller,She's asleep. Chandler?,val
Monica Geller,What are you doing?,val
Chandler Bing,Emma was doing it!,val
Monica Geller,She's asleep.,val
Chandler Bing,"Ooh, she's asleep, that means we can...",val
Monica Geller,"Yes, but we have to be fast.",val
Chandler Bing,"Okay, I'll try. And you can't make any noise.",val
Monica Geller,"Okay, I'll try.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Hello?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Emma? Hey! Hi!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"How are ya? How are ya? Where are your babysitters, huh? Why's the bedroom door closed?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"You can't have S-E-X, when you're taking care of the B-A-B-I-E!",val
Ross Geller,"Eh, if it was meant to be, it's meant to be.",val
Ross Geller,"Wow, free crab cakes. Well, that's nice. Although I was hoping to have sex tonight.",val
Ross Geller,Just the crab cakes.,val
Ross Geller,What's - what's going on?,val
Ross Geller,What? You - you're making money off my misery?,val
Ross Geller,"This is unbelievable. I - I have never been so insulted in my life. Now, if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes, I'll be on my way.",val
Monica Geller,"Well, that was weird. You were loud, and I was fast.",val
Chandler Bing,I think we may have really done it this time.,val
Monica Geller,"Oh, I wish I didn't have to wait to take a pregnancy test.",val
Chandler Bing,You may wanna get some more of those too.,val
Chandler Bing,Where's Emma?,val
Monica Geller,"Oh my god, where's Emma? Where's Emma?",val
Chandler Bing,"Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!",val
Monica Geller,"Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma. You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell.",val
Chandler Bing,Okay.,val
Monica Geller,"Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another, we're giving a baby back to Rachel.",val
Rachel Green,"No, no, no, I admire a man who can cry.",val
Rachel Green,Don't touch my coat!,val
Rachel Green,"Oh, sorry, it's my phone. Hello?",val
Monica Geller,"Hey, Rach, how's it going?",val
Rachel Green,"Oh my god, this is the worst date ever!",val
Rachel Green,"Look, you know what, I'm sorry, but did you really think that this was going well? What's up?",val
Monica Geller,"Hey, did you stop by here?",val
Rachel Green,No.,val
Monica Geller,"Oh my god, then...",val
Monica Geller,"Oh, thank god! Emma, there you are!",val
Rachel Green,"What? What do you mean, ""there you are""? Where was she?",val
Monica Geller,"Oh, we were playing ""peek-a-boo."" She just - she loves it when I'm dramatic.",val
Monica Geller,Why the hell did you take her?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Because you two were having sex!,val
Monica Geller,"No, we weren't!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?,val
Chandler Bing,"All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.,val
Chandler Bing,"No, no, no.",val
Monica Geller,"No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I gotta! Unless...",val
Monica Geller,Unless what?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Unless you name your firstborn child Joey.,val
Chandler Bing,What? Why?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, I may never have kids, and somebody's gotta carry on my family name.",val
Chandler Bing,Your family name is Tribbiani.,val
Joey Tribbiani,You almost had me.,val
Rachel Green,"Well, uh...",val
Rachel Green,"Really, really not.",val
Rachel Green,"All right, well that's good to know. Good night, Steve.",val
Ross Geller,"Hey, what's wrong?",val
Rachel Green,I just had a rough night.,val
Ross Geller,Oh. Crab cake?,val
Rachel Green,Eww!,val
Ross Geller,"Well, what happened?",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, well, I...It's kind of weird talking to you about this, but...",val
Ross Geller,Monica told me you had a blind date.,val
Rachel Green,Yeah.,val
Ross Geller,"I did, too.",val
Rachel Green,Oh.,val
Ross Geller,But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up?,val
Rachel Green,"Oh, oh no. Do you think she walked in, saw you and left?",val
Ross Geller,Why does everyone keep saying that?,val
Rachel Green,"Well, if it makes you feel any better, I wish my date hadn't shown up.",val
Ross Geller,That bad?,val
Rachel Green,"Well, he makes t-shirts for a living, and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this.",val
Ross Geller,Female body inspector? What size is that?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Uh-huh.,val
Phoebe Buffay,How - how do I get them to name the next one after me?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"It's easy, you just walk in on them having sex.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, so they owe me like, three Phoebes.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Don't, don't do the plan-laugh.",val
Ross Geller,"The first date we've had in months, and they were both such disasters.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh. Huh. You know, it is weird that Phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that Joey set you up on a date that didn't even show.",val
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute; you don't think it was intentional? I mean, that's just stupid.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"We're geniuses! Yeah, look at them, look at them, they're really bonding.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, yeah, they're falling in love all over again.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, they see us! Oh, they, they look mad. Oh, they figured it out. They're coming this way. Run!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Where?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Mexico! End credits.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Can you believe they're still not here?,val
Ross Geller,"I know. A double blind date, and we both get stood up. What are the chances?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, I'm so bummed. Can we have our free crab cakes now?",val
Joey Tribbiani,We've been stood up. And we want our free crab cakes.,val
Chandler Bing,"Guys, guys, I've got great news! Guess what.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, ah, Monica's pregnant?!",val
Monica Geller,Really? Let's get past the moment.,val
Phoebe Buffay,What's your news?,val
Chandler Bing,Thank you. I got a job in advertising.,val
Monica Geller,"Oh, honey, that's incredible!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Gosh, what's the pay like? Oh, come on people... come on, now, if I don't know who makes the most, how do I know who I like the most! Hey Joey!",val
Chandler Bing,"Actually, it pays nothing. It's an internship.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, that's cool. We have interns at 'Days Of Our Lives'.",val
Chandler Bing,"Right. So, it'll be the same except... less sex with you.",val
Ross Geller,"So, uh, what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there?",val
Chandler Bing,"Well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.",val
Phoebe Buffay,That's great.,val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I mean, there's probably gonna be some ground work which will probably stink, you know, grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating.",val
Chandler Bing,Humiliating and noble!,val
Ross Geller,"You know, if I didn't already have a job, I think, I would have been really good in advertising.",val
Monica Geller,"Ross, you did not come up with ""got milk?""",val
Ross Geller,"Yes, I did, I did! I should have written it down!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,val
Monica Geller,Hey!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Where's Chandler? I wanna wish him good luck on his first day. ... and I smelled bacon.,val
Monica Geller,He just left.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Who did?,val
Rachel Green,Joey! You never gonna believe it: she called.,val
Joey Tribbiani,She did?,val
Rachel Green,You got it!,val
Joey Tribbiani,I did?,val
Monica Geller,What is she talking about?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"I don't know, but it sounds great.",val
Rachel Green,Your agent called. You got that audition.,val
Joey Tribbiani,With Lennart Haze?,val
Rachel Green,Yes.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh my god, that is great! That is *** for a play on broadway... and in a real theatre, not that little one underneath the dally like last time.",val
Monica Geller,Is it a good play?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, it must be, because I read and I didn't understand a singe word.",val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, and Lennart Haze is starring in it.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah, and directing.",val
Monica Geller,He was so good in that movie of MacBeth.,val
Rachel Green,You saw that?,val
Monica Geller,"No, but... I saw the previews. They played it right before Jackass.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, he's done some amazing works.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, yeah. Oh, I loved him in those cell phone commercials.",val
Joey Tribbiani,I know. When the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone.,val
Monica Geller,Hey! Maybe the monkey will be at the audition!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Don't make me more nervous than I already am!,val
Chandler Bing,"Good morning, everybody.",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, no, no, I'm an intern, just like you guys... except for the tie, the briefcase... and the fact that I can rent a car.",val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, well, I'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.",val
Chandler Bing,"Right. Look, I know I'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like I'm Bob Hope.",val
Chandler Bing,The comedian? USO?!,val
Joey Tribbiani,It is so amazing to meet you. I'm such a big fan of your work.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Tell me about it! ""Unlimited nights and weekends!""",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I-I-I wasn't making fun of you, honestly, I-I think you were great in those commercials.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Are you kiddin'? When they shoot you out of that cannon.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Wow!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yah, sure.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Err, ""I think you know"".",val
Joey Tribbiani,"""I am what you made me. You know what? I could go right now.""",val
Joey Tribbiani,"""I can't. Oh, I want to, long pause, but I can't.""",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, oh, I thought that was your character's name, you know, I thought you were like an Indian or something, you know with a...",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, y-y-you're sure you don't want me to do it again? I could do it with an accent, you know, Southern ""I could go right now, maaan!""",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, hi, ah. Thank you so much for whispering for my benefit, but, ah, look, if you just tell me what I did wrong, I'd just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you. And, and also: 'How you doing?' You should, please, just gimme another chance. I really wanna get better, please.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.,val
Joey Tribbiani,I really doubt that.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Couldn't I just sleep with the producer?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, do you wanna go to dinner tonight?",val
Ross Geller,"Oh, I can't. I've got a date with that waitress, Katy, yeah, I know we've been only going out like twice, but I have a really good feeling about her.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I hear divorce bells.",val
Ross Geller,What?,val
Ross Geller,"O-ok. Just relax, Phoene, just stay calm. . Oh my god, I can't find my wallet.",val
Phoebe Buffay,No.,val
Ross Geller,"What do you mean ""no""? I knew you'd be my death, Phoebe Buffay.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Lowell, is that you?",val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my god!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, Ross, this is my old friend Lowell from the streets. Lowell, Ross.",val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, a real pleasure.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ah, it's been so long, so long. I can't believe you're still doing this!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Good for you!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Ouh...,val
Ross Geller,"Oh my god. Phoebe, you used to mug people?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Excuse me, Ross, old friends catching up.",val
Monica Geller,"Hey, how did the audition go?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, they wanna see me again this afternoon, but, err, well, Lennart Haze did not like me.",val
Monica Geller,What happened?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, he said I wasn't urgent enough, you know, and that everything I did was horizontal and I should be more vertical. Oh, and he said that I should think less.",val
Monica Geller,So far so good!,val
Chandler Bing,"Honey, I'm old!",val
Monica Geller,What's wrong?,val
Chandler Bing,I am so much older than these other interns. I can't compete with them.,val
Monica Geller,So you're a little older. Try to look at the positive: You have all this life experience.,val
Chandler Bing,"Yes, but I don't think life experience with these.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Wooooooooow It's like they're on fire!,val
Monica Geller,What are they?,val
Chandler Bing,They're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which I can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.,val
Joey Tribbiani,I give you $ 500 for them!,val
Chandler Bing,What am I supposed to do with these?,val
Monica Geller,"Ah, come on, sneakers are easy. You wear sneakers all the time.",val
Chandler Bing,"Well, first of all, they're not called ""sneakers"" anymore. Apparently, they're called ""kicks"" or ""skids"" and I think I heard somebody say ""slorps"". And here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. Kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity! Would you help me try to sell these?",val
Monica Geller,"Okay, have you considered using a girl with huge knockers?",val
Chandler Bing,"No, I don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, that'd work on me! Why did I get to buy Mrs. Butterwords?",val
Ross Geller,"Hey, you'll never guess what just happened... Phoebe and I got mugged!",val
Monica Geller,You okay?!,val
Ross Geller,"Yah, because Phoebe knew the mugger!",val
Monica Geller,How do you know a mugger?,val
Phoebe Buffay,I'm sorry I have friends outside the six of us.,val
Ross Geller,You wanna know how she knew him? Because Phoebe used to mug people.,val
Monica Geller,Seriously?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I'm not proud of it, but, you know... sometimes when I was living on the street and I needed money for food and stuff I.",val
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, that is awful!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, ok, I wasn't rich like you guys, ok, I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony... I had a hard life, my mother was killed by a drug dealer.",val
Monica Geller,You're mother killed herself!,val
Phoebe Buffay,She was a drug dealer!,val
Ross Geller,"Well, anyway, it was a good thing Phoebe knew the knew him, because I was about to do some serious damage!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.,val
Monica Geller,"Well, this must've brought back some really bad memories for you, Ross.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Why?,val
Monica Geller,"Well, Ross was mugged as a kid.",val
Phoebe Buffay,You were?,val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it was pretty traumatic. I was outside St. Marc's Comics... you know, I-I-I was just there minding my own business, you know, seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week-",val
Monica Geller,Wonderwoman!,val
Ross Geller,"Anyway, I was heading towards this bakery, you know, to pick up a couple of dozen Linzer torts for someone... ... when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says: ""Gimme your money, punk!""",val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my god.,val
Ross Geller,"I know! And-and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork I had done for my own comic book: ""Science Boy""",val
Monica Geller,Oh yeah! What was his superpower again?,val
Ross Geller,A superhuman thirst for knowledge.,val
Monica Geller,That's it.,val
Ross Geller,"Well, I-I better get to class Are there any more of your friends I should look out for on my way, Phoebe?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"No... actually, you might wanna stay away from Jane street... that's where stabby Joe works.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, I think we have a problem here.",val
Monica Geller,What?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, uhm, back in my mugging days, you know, I, uhm, I worked St. Marc's Comics.",val
Monica Geller,Yeah?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, a pipe was my weapon of choice and, uhm, pre-teen comic book nerds were my meat.",val
Monica Geller,So?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said-",val
Monica Geller,Oh my god!,val
Phoebe Buffay,I know... I mugged Ross!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, I'm sorry, but can I just have a quick second to run to the bathroom?",val
Joey Tribbiani,But I'm bursting with u-hu!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Actually, I really need.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Yes... ahahaaa.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"""I think you know!""",val
Joey Tribbiani,"""I am what you made me! You know what?""",val
Joey Tribbiani,"""I could go right now.""",val
Joey Tribbiani,"""I, oh, I can't. I want to, but I can't!""",val
Joey Tribbiani,I did?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Sure, yeah. I don't have time to say thank you because I really gotta go.",val
Monica Geller,Hey!,val
Chandler Bing,Hey!,val
Monica Geller,What are you doing?,val
Chandler Bing,"Putting on the sneakers... thought I'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, anything yet?",val
Chandler Bing,"Yes, how's this: They're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Probably wanna know what I'm doing...?,val
Monica Geller,"No, that seems about right.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yesterday at my audition, I really had to pee, and apparently, having to pee makes me a really good actor. I got a call-back, so I'm drinking everything. Oh, by the way, that egg nog in our fridge was great!",val
Rachel Green,"Joey, that was formula.",val
Joey Tribbiani,We gotta get more of that.,val
Chandler Bing,You know what... these aren't half-bad! You should suggest something like these to Ralph Lauren.,val
Rachel Green,"Okay, first of all, that's stupid and second of all, I'm not allowed to talk to Ralph.",val
Chandler Bing,Alright I feel youger already!,val
Chandler Bing,"Yah, I think I broke my hip.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, you!",val
Ross Geller,Hey!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, how was class?",val
Ross Geller,"No one ever asked me that, what's wrong?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Nothing, I really wanna know.",val
Ross Geller,"Oh... Well, uhm, there was actually a rather lively discussion about the Pleistocene.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Alright, nothing is worth this. Uhm, I have a confession to make... uhm, okay, you know, that girl that mugged you when you were a kid.",val
Ross Geller,Wh-What are you talking about? It wasn't a girl. It was this huge dude.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"You don't have to lie anymore, Ross, I know that it was a fourteen year-old girl.",val
Ross Geller,"No, it wasn't.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, it was.",val
Ross Geller,"No, it wasn't. You don't think I would've defended myself against a fourteen year-old.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"""Gimme your money, punk!""",val
Ross Geller,"Oh my god, it was you! I can't believe it, you... you mugged me?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, and I'm so, so sorry, Ross, I'm sorry, but, you know, if you think about it, it's kinda neat. I mean, well, it's just that I I've always felt kinda like an outsider, you know, the rest of you have these connections that go way back and, you know, now, you and I have... have a great one!",val
Ross Geller,It's not the best!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, I'm sorry, please forgive me. I don't know what to say.",val
Ross Geller,There's nothing you can say. That was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Really? Even more humiliating than.,val
Ross Geller,"Hey, let's not do this!",val
Chandler Bing,Okay... You start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes. He's about my age.,val
Chandler Bing,"A-huh. So he's rolling down the street and he starts to lose control, you know... maybe he falls... maybe hurts himself. Just then, a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes. He jumps over the old guy and laughs, and the line reads: ""Not suitable for adults!""",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, thank you, sir... or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me.",val
Chandler Bing,"I don't know, I don' I don' know! I was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.",val
Chandler Bing,The cold weather hurts my hip!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, Ross! I know you're still mad at me, but can I just talk to you for a second?",val
Ross Geller,"Sure, go ahead. Whoops, sorry, sure, go ahead.",val
Phoebe Buffay,I just really wanted to apologize again and... and also show you something I think you'll find very exciting.,val
Ross Geller,"Oh my god, crap from the street?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Look, Ross, in this box are all the things I got from mugging that I thought were too special to sell... or smoke. Anyway, I was looking through it and I found ""Science Boy""",val
Ross Geller,Oh my god. I never thought I'd see this again. It's all here. What made you save it all these years?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"I can't say, I just thought it was really good... and... maybe would be worth something some day.",val
Ross Geller,"You really thought ""Science Boy"" was worth saving!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah... but you should know, I also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here.",val
Ross Geller,"Still... this is amazing... Oh my god, thank you, Phoebe.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"You're welcome. And thank you for ""Science Boy"". I learned a lot from him.",val
Ross Geller,You're welcome.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"""I need an answer!""",val
Joey Tribbiani,"""You know!""",val
Joey Tribbiani,"""I need an answer now!""",val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"""You knew this all along and you never told me? You never told me? I can never forgive you, I can never forgive myself, I have nothing to live for Bang End Scene!""",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh thanks, thanks! Now, I really have to get.",val
Monica Geller,"Wow, that's a big cable bill! Huh, you don't have a job, but you have no problem ordering porn... on a Saturday afternoon?! I was in the house!",val
Ross Geller,"Hey, uhm, Phoebe didn't by any chance mention that.",val
Monica Geller,... that she was the huge guy that mugged you? Yah.,val
Ross Geller,I see. You didn't happen to tell.,val
Monica Geller,... everybody we know? Yeah.,val
Ross Geller,Great. Thanks!,val
Chandler Bing,Did you see our bank statement? Can this be right?,val
Monica Geller,I know...God. I haven't seen my savings take a hit like this since I was a kid and they came up with double-stuffed Oreos. What happened to all our money?,val
Chandler Bing,"I'm not sure what they did, but I'm inclined to blame Enron.",val
Monica Geller,"I guess with you doing the internship, we're just spending more than we're bringing in.",val
Chandler Bing,Maybe I should quit and get a job that pays.,val
Monica Geller,"Oh, But you're finally doing something that you love! I can't ask you to give that up. Though it'd be nice if the thing that you love was y'know... finding gold.",val
Chandler Bing,You know what? You know what? I think we're making too big a deal out of this. ok? So we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things. And maybe we start eating out of Joey's refrigerator for a change. You're chef... what can you make out of backing soda and beer?,val
Monica Geller,Ok worse case scenario is...we borrow some money from my parents.,val
Chandler Bing,No! We're not borrowing money.,val
Monica Geller,Why not?,val
Chandler Bing,Because we don't do that. We are Bings! And if there's one thing my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool house... but the other thing was never borrow money.,val
Monica Geller,Wow! I Had no idea you had this much pride.,val
Chandler Bing,That's right! I do! And I'm your man. And I'm going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Why??,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh...you don't have to go, I have something that will fit you.",val
Phoebe Buffay,I want you to stay.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Why don't you turn them inside ou...,val
Phoebe Buffay,I'll miss you.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Great! Ok...I'll go get the tube top.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, Mike Hannigan...You sure know how to make a girl say ""Hell yeah!""",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah! Let's do it! Let's live together! Oh god, we're really going to move in together!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"I've always wanted to live with a guy. ""Pick up your socks!"" ""Put down the toilet seat!"" ""No! We're not having sex anymore!"" It's gonna be fun!",val
Monica Geller,Hey Joey!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,val
Monica Geller,"Listen...I need to know that what I'm about to ask you, will never get back to Chandler.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it myself. Chandler is my best friend, it would be wrong. Good......But wrong.",val
Monica Geller,Ok first of all...It would be great. But that's not what I'm here to talk to you about. I need to borrow some money.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Aww, I don't know Monica y'know... erm... lending friends money is always a mistake.",val
Monica Geller,But Chandler lent you money!,val
Joey Tribbiani,And I think he would tell you it was a mistake.,val
Monica Geller,Come on...I just need it for some rent and..and some other bills.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh...how much?,val
Monica Geller,Two thousand dollars?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Two thousand dollars!? What do you think I am? I soap opera star!?,val
Monica Geller,Yeah...,val
Joey Tribbiani,That's right I am!,val
Rachel Green,Hi you guys!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Oo...what's in the bag?,val
Rachel Green,"Oh er... well you know Emma started crawling? I realised that this place, is very unsafe for a baby. So I went to the store and got some stuff to baby-proof the apartment.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. ""Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!"" or er.. ""Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!"" Huh!",val
Monica Geller,"Anyway erm, are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff?",val
Rachel Green,No. I was just going to do this myself.,val
Joey Tribbiani,You're gonna do it?,val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, Why? You don't think a woman can do this?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, women can. You can't.",val
Rachel Green,Monica...would you please tell Joey that he is a pig?,val
Monica Geller,You're a pig. And you can't do this.,val
Rachel Green,Wha!? What!? Come on! I found the hardware store all by myself!,val
Joey Tribbiani,The hardware store is right down the street.,val
Rachel Green,There is a hardware store right down the street?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey you guys! Ok, we've got great news.",val
Phoebe Buffay,I know it's so exciting! You know I've never lived with a guy before.,val
Monica Geller,"Well you know it's just like living with a girl. Only they don't steal your makeup. Unless they're playing ""This is what my sister would look like""",val
Chandler Bing,Yeah.... she's not so cute.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, well you put down the toilet seat.",val
Monica Geller,Is that a bit you guys do?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Uh huh...we're playing you two.,val
Monica Geller,We don't do that! Tell her we don't do that!,val
Chandler Bing,Yes dear.,val
Ross Geller,"I can't believe you guys are moving in together. That's, that's great! I mean...I'm happy for you guys..",val
Monica Geller,I hear wedding bells.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Monica slow down! Ok? I'm just excited to be living with him. You know I mean, I don't know, Can I see someday being married to Mike? Sure! Yeah. Y'know..I can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way. But do I want that house in Connecticut...you know..near the good schools where Mike and I can send Sophie and Mike Junior.. Oh my god I do.",val
Ross Geller,"Phoebe, I had no idea you were so conventional.",val
Phoebe Buffay,I know! I guess I am! Oh my god! Load up the Volvo I want to be a soccer mom!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! You bet roomy!,val
Monica Geller,Don't you mean..groomy?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh please, these guys, we haven't even moved in yet and they have us picking out china patterns.",val
Phoebe Buffay,China patterns!!!!!,val
Rachel Green,This is easy...Can't do this! Oh! Wow! Seriously I can't do this.,val
Chandler Bing,Hey Joe!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,val
Chandler Bing,Listen er..I need to ask you a favor but you can't tell Monica anything about it.,val
Joey Tribbiani,I thought you didn't have secrets from Monica.,val
Chandler Bing,And that would have made the official party line. Monica and I are having a little financial trouble.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I know.",val
Chandler Bing,What? What do you mean you know?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Err... I just figured it out! You know, I mean you're not working and the economy is bad.",val
Chandler Bing,Oh! Right.,val
Joey Tribbiani,That's the fastest I have ever thought!,val
Chandler Bing,"Anyway, err... I need to borrow some money.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! Sure! How much? Two thousand dollars?,val
Chandler Bing,Yes! Two thousand dollars exactly! How do you know that!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Err...Well I...Know how much you used to make and I know how much your rent is.,val
Chandler Bing,Oh ok.,val
Joey Tribbiani,I am on fire! Chandler : Listen...this is really nice. Do you... Did you write a cheque to Monica for two thousand dollars? Did Monica borrow money from you?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Err... Kind of.,val
Chandler Bing,I can't believe her! Did she tell you we were having money problems?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh no no no no no... It wasn't... It wasn't because of your money problems, it was for something for her.",val
Chandler Bing,What?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Something personal.,val
Chandler Bing,What would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she wouldn't tell me about?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Boob job.,val
Monica Geller,I don't want her to get a boob job! That's crazy!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Well it's...It's not that crazy okay? Making them smaller, that would be crazy.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh! Alright. Well I think the reason people laugh is becuase it's a play on the word roomy.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh no! No no! Not at all. We're just moving in right now. See where it goes.,val
Phoebe Buffay,What do you mean?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh. Wow.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Was it really that bad?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, well that's bad. But don't you think it might be different with someone else? Perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet. Except for once in the ocean.",val
Phoebe Buffay,But it's just...,val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh!,val
Phoebe Buffay,No! I definitely don't wanna get married. No I just wanted to make sure you didn't want to too. Whew! Coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there's gonna be hell to pay mister!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah I get that.,val
Rachel Green,Hi!,val
Monica Geller,So you gave in and decided to call someone?,val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I don't know who I was kidding. I can barely use chopsticks.",val
Rachel Green,Oh thank you so much. Oh oh wait! You forgot your erm...Your game.,val
Chandler Bing,Hey Rach! There she is...My perfectly proportioned wife.,val
Rachel Green,Don't look at me I never get his jokes.,val
Monica Geller,Thank you?,val
Chandler Bing,Oh no..don't thank me. Thank you. You know there's not one thing I would change about you? Not one single thing! And definitely not... two... single things.,val
Monica Geller,"Ok, you're being wierd. Do you want sex or did you do something bad?",val
Chandler Bing,"No no! I just love the way you look, I am warm, for your form.",val
Monica Geller,"Ok..You know the old classics you know,You look nice? They're still ok.",val
Chandler Bing,"Well yes yes... You look nice can mean that your face looks nice. I want to compliment your body. I mean..I wouldn't change it. At all. And more specifically, I wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.",val
Monica Geller,Okay...,val
Chandler Bing,"I mean, You wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would you? Don't answer that.",val
Rachel Green,Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any wierder.,val
Monica Geller,I know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?,val
Rachel Green,"I don't know! I mean, what brought that on?",val
Monica Geller,Oh my god. We're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out about the fact that my body is going to change.,val
Rachel Green,No you really think that's what it is?,val
Monica Geller,"You heard him! ""No bigger!"" ""You're perfect!"" ""Just don't get any bigger!"" Oh my god he sounded just like my high school wrestling coach. You know what? I'm going to have to talk to Chandler.",val
Rachel Green,"Yeah! If you don't I will! Of course your body's gonna change. Your breasts are gonna get bigger, your ass is gonna get bigger, you're gonna lose bladder control. God! It's just such a magical time!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.,val
Ross Geller,Hey!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Listen, I wanted to ask you something about marriage.",val
Ross Geller,Oh great now you're seeking me out to make jokes? I mean I can see for all hanging out but to come to my home!,val
Phoebe Buffay,No...I really wanted to know how you feel about it.,val
Ross Geller,Why?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Mike doesn't ever wanna get married.,val
Ross Geller,Never?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Never.,val
Ross Geller,"wow, are you still going to move in with him?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"I want to, but I just want you to tell me that marriage isn't really that big a deal. You know that I won't, I won't be missing out on anything. That marriage stinks!",val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, marriage... stinks! I mean if you wanna see a man gain weight and a woman stop shaving? Get them married.",val
Phoebe Buffay,That's not how you really feel is it?,val
Ross Geller,"No, I'm sorry. Look I don't think that's what you wanna hear right now but I can't help it. I love marriage.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Seriously? You divorce-o?,val
Ross Geller,"If you have to call me name, I prefer ""Ross the Divorcer"". It's just cooler. Look, I know my marriage isn't exactly work out. But I love to be that committed to another person. And Carol had some good times before she became a lesbian... and once afterward. I'm sorry.",val
Phoebe Buffay,It's ok that's how you feel.,val
Ross Geller,But come on! I mean living together will be great! I mean you guys have so much fun and you love Mike.,val
Phoebe Buffay,I do love Mike.,val
Ross Geller,"Yeah see? And you are so excited about moving in together before, and you know what? You should be. It's a big deal!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah I guess you're right. Yeah thanks. This helped. Thanks.,val
Ross Geller,"The Divorcer, to the rescue!",val
Phoebe Buffay,It's not cooler.,val
Ross Geller,Yeah I just hurt it.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Rach?! Rachel!!!!? So I can't do anything I like????,val
Chandler Bing,Hey Rach! Ah........ Perfection. Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.,val
Monica Geller,Honey?,val
Chandler Bing,Yeah?,val
Monica Geller,About that? Erm...I'm going to change.,val
Chandler Bing,But honey you don't have to.,val
Monica Geller,I'm going to get bigger!,val
Chandler Bing,Honey I... I love your breasts the way they are!,val
Rachel Green,Argh. fascist.,val
Monica Geller,"Well, my breasts are going to get bigger weather you like it or not! And you know what? It's not just my breasts. My ass is going to get bigger too.",val
Chandler Bing,your ass?!?!?,val
Rachel Green,"Man, don't be surprised if her hands and her feet get bigger too!",val
Chandler Bing,They...do that?,val
Monica Geller,It's kind of a package deal!,val
Chandler Bing,God why why would you want to do that to yourself!?,val
Monica Geller,I thought I was something that we both wanted!,val
Chandler Bing,"Alright look, if it means that much to you, a may be able to get on more with the big boobs. But the giant ass and the big clown feet?",val
Rachel Green,"Oh my god Chandler! If you can't handle this, what are you going to be like in the hospital? With the blood and the screaming and the little present that's shooting out of her!?",val
Chandler Bing,What?,val
Rachel Green,Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Because she is!,val
Monica Geller,"Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Mmmm hmm! For your boob job!,val
Joey Tribbiani,OK so I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?,val
Ross Geller,"Hey! What do you guys think about this. ""Ross: The Divorce-Force"".",val
Phoebe Buffay,Better.,val
Ross Geller,"Hey Pheebs, you know I'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and I hope I was a little helpful.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh yeah you were helpful! Yeah, no, thanks you.",val
Ross Geller,"Good, good. Yeah coz the more I thought about it, the more I realised I don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you.",val
Phoebe Buffay,What do you mean?,val
Ross Geller,"Well, I know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing? but is that really you? I mean can you honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?",val
Phoebe Buffay,They are awfully boxy...,val
Ross Geller,I don't know you'd be so bored with marriage. I mean it's so... normal.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Uh huh.,val
Ross Geller,"Hey hey, can I help?",val
Chandler Bing,"Well! We er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky.",val
Ross Geller,You know sometimes your words... they hurt.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey uh, where do you guys want this?",val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, seriously coz this is really heavy. I mean not for me because i'm only pretending to hold this, but for these guys.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Just one last time erm... the marriage thing... there's no wiggle room? None at all?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Right. Except that I do want to get married.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Couldn't have this conversation down at the truck huh?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Someday.,val
Chandler Bing,Aaaaand....... hernia.,val
Phoebe Buffay,I haven't exactly had a normal life and I never really felt I was missing out on anything but it just feels that now it's my turn some of the regular stuff.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Because I just didn't know how much I wanted it. And I love you, and I wanted to live with you.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"But I don't think I can! it was ok to move in when I didn't know what was gonna happen, but I can't move in knowing that nothing is ever gonna happen.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Are you gonna change yours?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Me neither. I think I need to be with someone who wants what I want.,val
Phoebe Buffay,I don't want it to end either.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.,val
Rachel Green,I'm so sorry Pheebs.,val
Monica Geller,We're all sorry...,val
Chandler Bing,"Ah, look on the bright side, I mean you won't have to live with this ugly chair! That was here already huh? I love you.",val
Joey Tribbiani,AH HAH! I DID IT! HA HA! Alright... Better take all I can carry. Who knows when i'll be able to get in here again!,val
Chandler Bing,Hey! Ready to go?,val
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah, let me just finish this.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Ross, check this out! yeah, I can't do that!",val
Chandler Bing,What are you doin'?,val
Ross Geller,"Have you seen this? It's a new alumni website for college! It's cool! You can post messages for people, let everyone know what you're up to.",val
Chandler Bing,"Great, a faster way to tell people that I'm unemployed and childless .",val
Ross Geller,It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing... remember Andrea Rich?,val
Chandler Bing,The tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?,val
Ross Geller,"Uh uh... well, her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident...",val
Chandler Bing,Bet she'd sleep with you now...,val
Ross Geller,No... I already e-mailed her.,val
Chandler Bing,"Let me see what you wrote about yourself: ""Doctor Paleontology, two kids... "" You split with Carol because you have different interests?... I think you split with Carol because you've one very similar interest!",val
Ross Geller,"You know what? I'm gonna finish this later, ok? Let me just grab my coat.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,val
Ross Geller,What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes??,val
Chandler Bing,"Maybe we finish this for him! ""Also I cloned a dinosaur in my lab. She's now my girlfriend. I don't care what society says. It's the best sex I've ever had""... aaand SEND!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no... what do... you can't do that to him!",val
Ross Geller,"Alright, let's go!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Dude!,val
Ross Geller,I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house!,val
Joey Tribbiani,aaand SEND! Opening credits.,val
Rachel Green,Hey! How was basketball?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, no! Who did that?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Chandler... hey... Rach... what's Hugsy doin' in the crib with Emma?,val
Rachel Green,"She was just crawling around and she found him, so I just let her sleep with him. That's all right? Isn't it?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, yeah... of course... yeah... it's a stuffed animal... you know... it's for kids... not for adults... I know that!",val
Rachel Green,"Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount...",val
Rachel Green,"All right... Oh, Emma loves him!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Why wouldn't she? He's a wonderful person!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Hi.,val
Monica Geller,Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Breaking up sucks! Oh, I really miss Mike!",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I'm so sorry!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh God, I tried everything to make myself feel better. I even tried writing a song about it... but... I can't think of anything that rhymes with AARRGGHH!! Hey Monica, I really need your help getting through this...",val
Chandler Bing,You're not gonna need my help?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well no, when I get to the point where... you know... I'm ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about Mike... I'm gonna come to you.",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh good, 'cause I've already thought of 3... 4! I've just thought of a fourth.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok. I mean I know I did the right thing. You know, Mike never wants to get married and I shouldn't be in a relationship that has no future... but... pretty soon I'm gonna miss him so much. I'm gonna wanna see him again and you have to stop me from doing that.",val
Monica Geller,"Ok, you got it!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Unless... Maybe it's too crazy about this... Alright so... you know, there is no future... but that doesn't mean we still can't have fun. You know what? Forget what I said.",val
Monica Geller,Really? If that's what you want...,val
Phoebe Buffay,That was a test and you just failed.,val
Monica Geller,Damn it! Rookie mistake!,val
Ross Geller,I have sex with dinosaurs??,val
Chandler Bing,I believe I read that somewhere!,val
Ross Geller,"That only is not funny, it's physically impossible! Ok? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long... It's not funny!!",val
Chandler Bing,I respectfully disagree.,val
Ross Geller,I can't believe you put that on my alumni page!,val
Chandler Bing,Who cares? Nobody reads those things.,val
Ross Geller,You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today.,val
Chandler Bing,I don't have a page.,val
Ross Geller,Oh oh oh! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE!!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel... with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya. It's okay, Emma, you stay asleep.",val
Rachel Green,": Step away from the crib, I have a weapon!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.",val
Rachel Green,What are you doing?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go to the bathroom.",val
Joey Tribbiani,There you go sweetie... This isn't over.,val
Monica Geller,"Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... ""gay as the day is long""?",val
Chandler Bing,Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.,val
Monica Geller,But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.,val
Chandler Bing,Would you get that please? People have been calling to congratulate me all day.,val
Monica Geller,"Hello? No, he's not here. Yeah, this is his wife. Yeah, well, it came as quite a shock to me too. I guess I should have known. Yeah, I mean, he just kept making me watch Moulin Rouge.",val
Chandler Bing,"Hang up, hang up. And that was a great movie! I'm so gonna get back at Ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go .",val
Monica Geller,What are you doing?,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, you'll see my friend.",val
Ross Geller,I'm dead?,val
Chandler Bing,And so young.,val
Ross Geller,Posting that I died? That really isn't funny.,val
Chandler Bing,"Well, how you died was funny.",val
Ross Geller,"Oh please, hit by a blimp?",val
Chandler Bing,It kills over one americans every year.,val
Ross Geller,"Unbelievable, my classmates are gonna think I'm dead, my professors, my... my parents are gonna get phone calls. You're messing with people's feelings here.",val
Chandler Bing,You wanna talk about people's feelings? You should have heard how hurt professor Stern was yesterday when I told him I wouldn't be able to go with him to Key West!,val
Ross Geller,"You've really crossed the line here, but that's okay, it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn. That's right! Your coming out is about to get real graphic.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"God, I wish Mike were here.",val
Monica Geller,Okay if Mike were here what would the two of you be doing?,val
Monica Geller,"What are you, animals? It's 4 o'clock in the afternoon!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"I gotta call him. Just to talk to him, there's no harm in that.",val
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. Give me your phone.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Here.,val
Monica Geller,And now your cell.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Okay.,val
Monica Geller,This is your cellphone?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Yes.,val
Monica Geller,This is your current cellphone?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yes, it reminds me of a simpler time.",val
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, where's your purse?",val
Monica Geller,"No, no! Give it to me!",val
Phoebe Buffay,You can't have it.,val
Monica Geller,Give it to me!,val
Phoebe Buffay,No.,val
Monica Geller,I'll go in there.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh yeah.,val
Monica Geller,Phoebe come here.,val
Monica Geller,Haha!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, look who's here! It's Joey, and he brought home a friend.",val
Rachel Green,"Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, it's not a girl, it's... a brand new Hugsy!",val
Rachel Green,"Oh that's so great, now Emma has two Hugsy's.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, Emma has one Hugsy, the new Hugsy, huh? The other Hugsy, I don't know, I guess I'll just take it back.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh you know what? When I was a little girl I had a little pink pony named Cotton. Oh I loved her so much, I took her everywhere, I would braid her tail...",val
Joey Tribbiani,Make the transfer!,val
Rachel Green,Should I be concerned that a button fell off the old Hugsy and I can't find it?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, no don't worry about that, I swallowed that years ago.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, I don't think she likes the new Hugsy.",val
Joey Tribbiani,But he's the same.,val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I think she wants the old one back.",val
Joey Tribbiani,But he's the same.,val
Rachel Green,"Joey, come on!",val
Joey Tribbiani,He's the same! .,val
Joey Tribbiani,You're not the same!,val
Monica Geller,Haha!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"You know, it's a lot less surprising to do that after I've buzzed you into the building.",val
Monica Geller,"So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Those are my shoes.,val
Monica Geller,"Oh, when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now.",val
Monica Geller,Who's that?,val
Phoebe Buffay,I ordered Chinese food.,val
Phoebe Buffay,What are the chances? 1 billion Chinese people and they send Mike!?,val
Monica Geller,What are you doing here?,val
Monica Geller,Phoebe!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sorry, I broke down... I wanted to see him.",val
Monica Geller,Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?,val
Phoebe Buffay,There is a speakerphone on the base unit...,val
Monica Geller,Base Unit! Think Monica! Think!,val
Monica Geller,This doesn't concern you!!,val
Monica Geller,"Look, guys, you can't do this, it's just going to make getting over each other, that much harder.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Not if nothing happens. Why can't... why can't we just hang out as friends?,val
Monica Geller,"Sure! If you're just gonna hang out as friends, then maybe I'll join ya. You know, I'm your friend and Mike's friend .",val
Phoebe Buffay,Sit down.,val
Monica Geller,Oh wow wow wow!! Make room for your friend!,val
Monica Geller,I've been pretty good!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Thanks, you look good too.",val
Monica Geller,Oh no no no no... this is dangerous territory. Keep it clean!,val
Phoebe Buffay,So how's the piano playing going?,val
Phoebe Buffay,I've missed you too.,val
Monica Geller,"You know, on the way over here, I saw this drunk guy throw up. And then a pigeon ate it!",val
Chandler Bing,"Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... ..don't tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me?",val
Ross Geller,"uhu uhu, check this out.",val
Chandler Bing,Huh! So that's what I would look like if I worked out... and was being serviced by a policeman. You're not actually going to send these out are ya?,val
Ross Geller,"Eh..actually no, I don't need to because your little ""Ross is dead"" joke didn't work, ok, there were no responses. Nobody posted anything on the website, nobody called my parents, so the joke my friend is on you. Nobody called, nobody wrote anything, nobody cares that I'm dead. Oh my God! Nobody cares that I'm dead!?",val
Chandler Bing,"No, come on, you know that's not true.",val
Ross Geller,What are you talking about? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet! I didn't get one response! And I'm dead!,val
Chandler Bing,"Well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.",val
Ross Geller,I can't believe this. Not even my geology lab partner? And I carried that guy!,val
Chandler Bing,"Alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? That people are gonna post condolences on a website? This is not about people not caring that you're dead .This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.",val
Ross Geller,You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.,val
Chandler Bing,"Right, I mean, come on, I'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.",val
Ross Geller,Exactly!!,val
Chandler Bing,"Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? You're having a memorial service for yourself!?",val
Ross Geller,No! That would be stupid! You're having it for me!,val
Chandler Bing,"Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !",val
Ross Geller,"oh, too late, too late! It's sent... oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man...",val
Rachel Green,"I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap, have you seen Hugsy?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Original or crappy?,val
Rachel Green,Original.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, sorry haven't seen him.",val
Rachel Green,Then what's that big lump under your covers?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"It's Monica, ok?",val
Rachel Green,That's not Monica!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright!! Fine! It's original Hugsy! No, now I know that Emma wants him but he's mine and I need him..",val
Rachel Green,Oh God.,val
Joey Tribbiani,... she's being unreasonable!,val
Rachel Green,"Joey, there is a reason that Emma loves that stupid penguin so much Oh don't cover its ears! It's because it reminds her of her uncle Joey!",val
Joey Tribbiani,It does?,val
Rachel Green,Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Really? She... she loves me?,val
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah! But you know what? If you need Hugsy, don't worry. Emma will totally understand. I won't... but whatever .",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, wait wait wait wait a minute wait a minute, I mean Rach, I mean if if... . If Hugsy means that much to Emma then... well she can have him.",val
Rachel Green,"Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. Look Emma, look who's baaack!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Look forget it forget it... I can't do it.,val
Rachel Green,Are you gonna... you're going to take Hugsy away from a little child?,val
Joey Tribbiani,How do you think I got him in the first place?,val
Monica Geller,"Alright you two, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Now I don't want anything going on while I'm gone. Here's a few things you can discuss: mucus, fungus and the idea of me and Ross doing it.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, I want that too, but IS that going to make it too hard?",val
Monica Geller,"Kiss him, you fool!!",val
Phoebe Buffay,What?,val
Monica Geller,Didn't you hear that speech? If you don't kiss him then I will!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I missed you so much!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Who is this?,val
Monica Geller,"Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!",val
Monica Geller,Excuse me?,val
Monica Geller,"Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.",val
Monica Geller,You didn't hear the speech!,val
Monica Geller,"Hey, it was very moving! You're just heartless!",val
Monica Geller,You're... weird!,val
Monica Geller,Oh !,val
Monica Geller,Damn it!,val
Monica Geller,And I blame you too.,val
Ross Geller,"It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up! I tell you, when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted!",val
Chandler Bing,There you go! Someone came!,val
Ross Geller,"Ok, ok! I'm gonna go hide! Oh, this is so exciting, my first mourner!",val
Monica Geller,"Hi, glad you could come.",val
Chandler Bing,"Please, come in.",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.",val
Chandler Bing,At least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps.,val
Ross Geller,Who is he?,val
Chandler Bing,"Some guy, Tom Gordon.",val
Ross Geller,"I don't remember him, but then again I touched so many lives.",val
Monica Geller,"So, did you know Ross well?",val
Monica Geller,"Yes, he is. Me.",val
Chandler Bing,"Ok Tommy, that's enough mourning for you! Here we go, bye bye!!",val
Chandler Bing,Ok!,val
Ross Geller,I'm dead and no one cares?,val
Monica Geller,I look like a man??,val
Chandler Bing,"Please, one ridiculous problem at a time!",val
Ross Geller,"It isn't ridiculous, look around! No one's here!",val
Chandler Bing,"You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!",val
Ross Geller,"Yes, you're right. Still somebody must have seen it... I mean, I went to that school for 4 years, I didn't have an impact on anyone?",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, that's not true. You had an impact on me, I mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. Doesn't that count for something?",val
Ross Geller,"Yeah... Oh, great. More party boys for Chandler!",val
Chandler Bing,"I'm sure it's somebody for you. Now, go hide.",val
Chandler Bing,Kori? Kori Weston?,val
Chandler Bing,Wow! You look amazing!,val
Chandler Bing,"Chandler, Chandler Bing. I'm not gay, I'm not gay at all.",val
Monica Geller,You are married though.,val
Chandler Bing,"Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!",val
Chandler Bing,I didn't know Ross and you were so close.,val
Chandler Bing,"I'm sure that would mean a lot to him. And if heaven has a door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.",val
Ross Geller,"But you didn't! I'm still alive!! Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you. It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day! I mean, the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people!",val
Ross Geller,Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!,val
Ross Geller,"No Mum, I'm not dead. I know it's not something to kid about. It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me, but it's over, ok? Actually no, even if I had died, you would not be left childless. Monica?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Monica, hey, can I borrow the Porsche?",val
Monica Geller,Ok.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Alright!,val
Monica Geller,But ehm...what is it not?,val
Joey Tribbiani,A place to entertain my lady friends.,val
Monica Geller,And what else is it not?,val
Joey Tribbiani,A place to eat spaghetti.,val
Monica Geller,Very good! What do you need it for anyway?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh well, the powerball lottery is upto 300 million and they don't sell tickets here in New York, so...",val
Rachel Green,Oh! So you're driving up to Connecticut?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah Connecticut...Not West Virginia.,val
Monica Geller,"Hey, maybe I'll drive you up there! I'd like to buy some tickets myself!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Uh!,val
Monica Geller,"Yeah with Chandler not getting paid, we could really use 300 million dollars.",val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, because if I was at my old job we'd say 300 million? No thank you!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Hey will you get me tickets too?,val
Rachel Green,"Yeah me too. oh! I have an idea. Why don't we all pitch in 50 bucks, we'll pool our money together and then if we win, we'll split it! Everyone almost simultaneously except Ross: yeah thats a great idea!",val
Ross Geller,No thanks!,val
Phoebe Buffay,You don't wanna win the lottery?,val
Ross Geller,"Uh...sure I do, and I also wanna be King of my own country and find out what happened to Amelia Earhart.",val
Chandler Bing,Still on Amelia Earhart?,val
Ross Geller,The woman just vanished!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Seriously, Ross, you don't want in on this?",val
Ross Geller,No! Do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery? I...I mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times.,val
Chandler Bing,Yes but there's six of us so we'd only have to get struck by lightning 7 times.,val
Joey Tribbiani,I like those odds!,val
Ross Geller,"Seriously you guys, I can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery, I mean that's such a bunch of boohaki.",val
Chandler Bing,I'll ask. Boohaki?,val
Ross Geller,"Oh oh, we think Emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her.",val
Rachel Green,"Yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm...boohaki, goshdarnit and brotherpucker.",val
Monica Geller,How do you know she's gonna start talking?,val
Rachel Green,Well when I talk to her I almost feel like she understands what I'm saying.,val
Chandler Bing,Kinda like Joey.,val
Joey Tribbiani,What's that now? Opening credits.,val
Monica Geller,God! Look at all these tickets! It's so exciting! You know I haven't won anything since the sixth grade.,val
Chandler Bing,Pie eating contest?,val
Monica Geller,Oh! You assume because I was heavy that's the only way I could win something?,val
Chandler Bing,"No, I saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.",val
Monica Geller,That was a good day!,val
Ross Geller,"They're towing your car, they're towing your car!!",val
Monica Geller,I'm parked in a garage on Morton!,val
Ross Geller,They're towing a car. And I am seeing...spots.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh my god Ross! You don't have Emma! And Rachel you don't have Emma! Where's Emma? Who has Emma!?,val
Rachel Green,Joey relax! My mother picked her up two hours ago. You were there!,val
Joey Tribbiani,I was?,val
Joey Tribbiani,I did?,val
Rachel Green,She dropped off a casserole?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh yeah! The casserole lady.,val
Monica Geller,"So, did you come by to watch us win the big bucks?",val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, uh... and then I figured after you win, we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it!",val
Chandler Bing,"Don't touch the phone! I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it!!",val
Ross Geller,Think he washed his hands?,val
Chandler Bing,"Hello? Hey Charlie, what do you know?",val
Rachel Green,What's going on?,val
Monica Geller,"Chandler is supposed to find out if he's getting an assistent job at his ad agency. But out of the 15 interns, they are only hiring three.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Ooh! Tough odds!,val
Ross Geller,Yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Look who's coming around!,val
Chandler Bing,Damnit. Alright call me when you know more.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Did you get it?,val
Chandler Bing,One of the slots got filled.,val
Joey Tribbiani,By you!?,val
Chandler Bing,Sense the tone! No that kid Nate got it.,val
Monica Geller,Oh! I hate that guy! I mean come on kid! Pull up your pants!,val
Chandler Bing,Yeah I know.,val
Rachel Green,"Well, there's two spots left right?",val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah...I mean I want this so much! I mean, I wanna get one, I want my friend Charlie to get one...Except I don't care about Charlie.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey you guys! Ok, you're not going to believe this! I just saw my psychic and she said I was definitely gonna win the lottery tonight!",val
Monica Geller,"Hey that reminds me, I thought we could use some extra luck so I brought a wishbone home from work.",val
Ross Geller,A psychic AND a wishbone? Guys! Give someone else a chance!,val
Monica Geller,"Alright, who wants to do it?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh can I? Vegetarians never get to do the wishbone. It's really not fair either! You know, just because we don't eat the meat doesn't mean we don't like to play with the carcasses!",val
Monica Geller,"Ok, hey Rach?",val
Rachel Green,"Oh no, I'm good, I don't wanna get that turkey smell all over my hands.",val
Joey Tribbiani,I'll do it!! It'll get the casserole stink off of mine.,val
Phoebe Buffay,I hope I win!,val
Monica Geller,"Well, it doesn't really matter ... you're both wishing for the same thing, right?",val
Joey Tribbiani,I can't tell you what I'm wishing for! Else...you know...won't come true!,val
Monica Geller,"Right! .. but we ""know"" what you're wishing for!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Can't really say!,val
Monica Geller,"I understand, but you're wishing for what we think you're wishing for, aren't you?",val
Joey Tribbiani,I'm not really comfortable with these questions!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"One, two, three!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"I won, hey!",val
Ross Geller,"You know what, I'm sure your wish is gonna come true, but, you guys - just in case, maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp! Ah!! That thing gets hot!!",val
Rachel Green,"You know, Ross, just keep making your jokes. How are you gonna feel if we actually do win?",val
Ross Geller,"Uh, you're not gonna win.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, I know, I know, the odds are against us, but somebody has to win, and it could be us! And then how you gonna feel? You know, we're gonna be all like ""oh everybody, let's take our helicopters up to the cape"" and you're gonna be all like ""oh, I can't guys, I'll meet you guys up there, I gotta gas up the Hyundai""",val
Ross Geller,"Ok, I've heard myself on tape and I sound nothing like that.",val
Chandler Bing,"I can see the headline now: ""Lottery winners' friend filled with regret eats own arm"".",val
Ross Geller,Why would I eat my own arm?,val
Chandler Bing,"Well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we can print whatever we want.",val
Monica Geller,"You know what, Ross? I'm gonna throw in 50 bucks for you.",val
Ross Geller,Why?,val
Monica Geller,"Because I know that you think the lottery is ""boohaki"" but we're all here and gonna watch the numbers and have fun. And you're my brother, and I want you to be a part of this.",val
Ross Geller,"You don't have to do that, I'll pay for myself. But just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys - that's so sweet! Come here.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Get a room!,val
Chandler Bing,"Ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do if we win?",val
Ross Geller,"I don't know, probably just invest it.",val
Chandler Bing,Ooh! Calm down ...,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Seriously, that's your fantasy? To invest it?",val
Ross Geller,"Oh, I'm sorry, did I say ""invest it""? I meant ""be cool and piss it all away""",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ooh, ooh, I know! We should pool all own money and buy the Knicks!",val
Rachel Green,I don't really care about the Knicks.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, you will when I pick you as starting forward.",val
Rachel Green,You would do that? I never get picked!,val
Chandler Bing,"You know, I'm not sure a sports team is the way to go.",val
Joey Tribbiani,You're not gonna let me buy the Knicks?? I can't believe you're taking this away from me!,val
Chandler Bing,"You're right, it has been you dream for over 15 seconds.",val
Ross Geller,"Uh, how long until they announce the numbers, Mommy?",val
Chandler Bing,I'll take this one too Uh ... Mommy?,val
Ross Geller,"Oh, I've gotten into the habit of calling Rachel ""Mommy"" when we're around Emma. Which I now realize we are not ...",val
Rachel Green,I'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word.,val
Ross Geller,"Although if we're gonna do that, we should probably call me ""Daddy"" too.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oooh, I like that, ""daddy""",val
Ross Geller,I ... I was just talking about Rachel.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oooh, is daddy getting angry? Is daddy gonna spank me?",val
Ross Geller,Well that depends ... have you been a baaad gi .. no I can't.,val
Chandler Bing,"Hello? Hello? Oh, hey Charlie. Did anybody else hear? ... What? Susan got it?? How? Oh man, I would have slept with him!! .. Alright, bye.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Dude, I'm sorry. But hey, there's one spot left, right?",val
Chandler Bing,"Well no, Charlie's gonna get that.",val
Monica Geller,"Hey, don't say that! You got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job!",val
Chandler Bing,He's the boss's son.,val
Monica Geller,"Come on, lottery!!",val
Rachel Green,"Ooh, you guys, it starts in like 20 minutes.",val
Monica Geller,"Ok, here we go. We need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we've won. So does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? Ok, how about this: we divide them into 6 groups of 40, and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.",val
Rachel Green,"Ooh, I have another idea!",val
Monica Geller,"I'm sorry, idea time is over.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, well, are all the tickets in the bowl?",val
Monica Geller,Yeah.,val
Chandler Bing,What about the ones you have on the nightstand?,val
Monica Geller,There are no tickets on the nightstand!,val
Chandler Bing,"Yes there are, I just saw them a few minutes ago.",val
Monica Geller,"Un, no you didn't! You must be mistaken!",val
Chandler Bing,"Honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!",val
Monica Geller,"Chandler, sense the tone!!",val
Rachel Green,"Well, well, well, look what mommy found!!",val
Monica Geller,"Ok, fine!! I bought 20 extra tickets for me and Chandler.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Uh! The psychic also said that I would be betrayed.,val
Ross Geller,"I can't believe this, I thought we were all in this together!",val
Monica Geller,"Hey, you just got in 5 minutes ago!",val
Ross Geller,3 minutes ago!!! I don't know why that's important ...,val
Joey Tribbiani,"I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut, when did you even get those?",val
Monica Geller,When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!,val
Joey Tribbiani,I'll show you how.,val
Rachel Green,"Ok, well Monica, suppose one of your ""special"" tickets win? How are you gonna feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends?",val
Monica Geller,"Please ... if I win the lottery, you guys are not gonna leave me. Someone gave me a basket of mini-muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for 3 days!",val
Rachel Green,"Chandler, would you just tell her what she did was wrong?",val
Chandler Bing,"She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us ...",val
Monica Geller,Ahhh!,val
Chandler Bing,"Let me finish ... however, it doesn't look like I'm gonna get this job so I can't afford to have principles, so screw you, the tickets are ours!!",val
Monica Geller,There's the man I married!!,val
Rachel Green,"All right, believe me.If you win the lottery, it's the last you're gonna hear from us!",val
Monica Geller,"Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! Yeah, and then I'll pay for their plastic surgery so they'd look just like you!",val
Rachel Green,"OH! Alright, you know what? That's it! I want my share of the tickets !",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I want my tickets too ! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graff, ah ah!",val
Ross Geller,"Than I want mine, too ! And if I win I'm gonna put it all into a very low-yield bond.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, you guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together.",val
Monica Geller,"No, no! We should divide them up and I should get extra because we used my card to buy them!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, if anybody gets extra tickets, it should be me! This all thing was my idea!",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!",val
Rachel Green,"Ok, that's it! Just give'em to me! I'll split them up!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh!,val
Phoebe Buffay,OOOOOHHHHH!,val
Ross Geller,"Hey, hey!!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"OOOOOHHHHH! Fine, I can't take it anymore! I'm putting an end to this!",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, if she jumps, I get her tickets.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"If we are not doing it together, we're not doing it at all! So, say goodbye to your tickets! .",val
Phoebe Buffay,Don't come any closer!,val
Chandler Bing,"Can I come a little bit closer, valuable things are getting squished...",val
Phoebe Buffay,"No, what's more important, your friends or money?",val
Monica Geller,Money! Friends...,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey Monica, what about your extra tickets?",val
Monica Geller,They're all in there! Even these five that I hid in my bra ...,val
Ross Geller,Monica!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, good! You guys were so scared! There was no way I was gonna dump this... Oh God, no! I think I broke your bowl.",val
Ross Geller,"Go, go, go!!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"What a beautiful night to be running around the street, looking for tickets. And the wind sure made it fun.",val
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, we lost half of them.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"So, what? Monica, we have the winning ticket! My psychic said I was gonna win, remember?",val
Ross Geller,Weird.. your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon...,val
Phoebe Buffay,"As a matter of fact she said that's how I am going to die. So, excuse me for being a little skittish.",val
Chandler Bing,"Hey, there's two messages. These could be from work!",val
Monica Geller,"Oh, play them!",val
Chandler Bing,"Ok, here we go!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, I bet that was very hard for him to do.",val
Chandler Bing,This is..shhh!,val
Monica Geller,"Oh God, I am so sorry honey...",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, it is so unfair. It's like that time they promoted Sandra over me at work.",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, is she related to Ralph Lauren?",val
Rachel Green,"No, she was just much better at job than me!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Guys, the drawing is about to start!",val
Rachel Green,You know what? We should call my mum's house and say goodnight to Emma before she goes down.,val
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah, it's a good idea!",val
Monica Geller,"Honey, you've been really strong about this, I know how badly you wanted that job.",val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, you know, I really thought I deserved it. But... let's go win the lottery... I mean, we still have 130 chances to win, right?",val
Monica Geller,131!,val
Ross Geller,"Goodnight sweetheart! I love you. And remember, you're daddy's little girl... Phoebe's totally ruined that for me...",val
Rachel Green,"Hi mum, put her back on!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Rach, come on! They are announcing the numbers! My God, I can already feel myself changing. TV: ""Here we are, the official Powerball numbers! We have 53""",val
Chandler Bing,I got that!,val
Ross Geller,"Oh, we have one too!!",val
Monica Geller,"We are on a roll, people!!",val
Ross Geller,Come on!!,val

Ross Geller,"Yeah, I ate all my gifts for everybody.",val
Chandler Bing,"Well, that's impossible, can you check again, please?",val
Ross Geller,Check again please!,val
Ross Geller,Not there.,val

Ross Geller,She doesn't know what to say!,val
Chandler Bing,Just give us the cheapest room you have.,val
Chandler Bing,That's insane!,val

Chandler Bing,What!? They are totally ripping us off!,val
Ross Geller,"Dude, don't worry 'bout it! I know how we can make your money back! This is a nice hotel, you know, plenty of amenities, we just load up on those! Like those apples. Instead of taking one, I'm... I take six!",val
Chandler Bing,"Great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!",val
Ross Geller,"C'mon, you get the idea, ow-ow-ow we'll make our money back in no time!",val
Chandler Bing,"Dude, you're shaking!",val
Ross Geller,"I think it's the sugar, could you hold the apple?",val
Rachel Green,Hi!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,val
Rachel Green,"Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking all day about that scene you did, I mean, you were amazing!",val

Rachel Green,just... don't talk...,val
Rachel Green,"Ehhh, aw! . Well, that's new!",val
Ross Geller,"Hi, this is Ross Geller in suite 206. It seems you forgot a couple of things. Could you have some complimentary toiletries sent up to my room? Thank you! Ok. Toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, mouthwash, deodorant, dental floss, band aids, shaving cream, after shave... and I feel like I am forgetting something... Is there anything else you have that I haven't asked for already? Yeah, go ahead, send up some tampons. Ross: What did you get?",val
Chandler Bing,USA Today.,val
Ross Geller,"Nice, put it with the others.",val
Chandler Bing,And I also got... two more apples.,val
Ross Geller,"We are four short of a bush-o . God I feel so alive, I love being in the country!",val
Chandler Bing,I also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.,val
Ross Geller,"Oh, that's not cool.",val
Chandler Bing,"Dude, none of this is cool.",val
Ross Geller,"No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example: hair drier, no, no, no, but shampoo and conditioners, yes, yes, yes. Now, the salt shaker is off-limits, but the salt I wish I'd thought this through.",val
Chandler Bing,"I think I know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.",val
Ross Geller,"Not my first time in a hotel, my friend.",val
Chandler Bing,"Ok, how about this ?",val
Ross Geller,"No, no, no, you can't take the remote control!",val
Chandler Bing,"Yes, but the batteries... Chandler: Thank you, thank you very much!",val
Ross Geller,Let's celebrate with some maple candy!,val
Chandler Bing,No!,val
Ross Geller,At least tell me where you hid it.,val
Rachel Green,Can I ask you a question?,val
Monica Geller,Yeah.,val
Rachel Green,Have you ever had any weird romantic dreams?,val
Monica Geller,"Let me think. Oh, when I was younger I used to dream that I got married to Mayor McCheese, and on our wedding night I ate his head.",val
Rachel Green,"Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey.",val
Monica Geller,"Wow, do you mean like kiss him-kiss him?",val
Rachel Green,"Oh yeah! I mean, that was pretty intense.",val
Monica Geller,What do you think brought than on?,val
Rachel Green,"I don't know! I mean, maybe that's something to do with the fact that I saw him do a love scene yesterday.",val
Monica Geller,A love scene? With who?,val
Rachel Green,Olivia.,val
Monica Geller,"Olivia? I thought she was marrying Connor! Oh right, real life more important.",val
Rachel Green,So do you think that my dream means anything?,val
Monica Geller,"I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake.",val
Rachel Green,Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...,val
Monica Geller,"Of course it was! Trust me, when it comes to psychology I know what I'm talking about. I took two psych classes in college.",val
Rachel Green,You took the same class twice.,val
Monica Geller,It was hard! Phoebe: Hey!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant uh, huh wait! Right? I mean, this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man.",val
Monica Geller,"Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Right, yeah, ok, I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault.",val
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, ok. Fine, I'll just, I'll take the hat back . Rachel: Hey, so you guys, the funniest thing happened, at work...",val
Phoebe Buffay,My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?,val
Rachel Green,"Ok, we're still on that.",val
Monica Geller,I didn't say your songs were not good enough.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Then what's wrong with them? Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?,val
Monica Geller,Tiny portions?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah well, ""excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but I can't see it, I can't see it""!",val
Monica Geller,"Phoebe, it's not about quantity.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Well...it's not about quality.,val
Monica Geller,"Oh really, you want to talk about quality? Have you heard of a key? It's what some people sing in.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica.",val
Monica Geller,"Ok, so that's what we're doing. You know, when I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing ear plugs.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ear plugs, or cloves of garlic?",val
Monica Geller,"You know what? I take back what I said before. You keep playing at the restaurant, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales are going up like crazy.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"What are people having, the garlic Martini?",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh we did, and you still have all your lamps. Chandler: Oh, I didn't factor in the room tax.",val
Ross Geller,"Oh dude, don't worry about it, I found an unattended maid's car. We're way ahead of the game. Ross: Oh my god.",val
Chandler Bing,What?,val
Ross Geller,There's something new in the bowl.,val
Chandler Bing,"Look, we have enough, just walk away.",val
Ross Geller,"No, but I want...I want the pinecones!",val
Chandler Bing,There's a forest right outside.,val
Ross Geller,It's not the same.,val
Chandler Bing,"Ok, go quick! Ross: Thank you for a delightful stay. Ross: Oh, my maple candy!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Food here at 'Javu'..will kill you..the food here at 'Javu' ...will kill you.. Monica: Thank god, it's just you! I thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself.",val
Monica Geller,"Ok, you have to stop playing now.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Why? The only person my playing is bothering is you!,val
Monica Geller,"Oh yeah? Ok, let's settle this, come on!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Get your garlic-peelers off me!,val
Monica Geller,"Excuse me, excuse me, hi, I'm Monica Geller..I'm the head chef here.. .. Ok, I was actually expecting a little applause there, but whatever! Ok, quick question: by a show of hands, how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, ok, how many of you enjoyed the music outside? Ha!",val
Monica Geller,"Alright, let me ask you this question: How many of you thought the music was fine, but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant? .",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, well, who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky?",val
Monica Geller,Ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, well, alright, who thinks the food is fine, the music was fine, but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking? .",val
Monica Geller,Excuse us! Alright here's a question: Who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh...Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great!,val
Monica Geller,I'm sorry...,val
Phoebe Buffay,I'm sorry too...,val
Monica Geller,ooohh... hey! Wanna stick around and I'll whip you up some dinner?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah! As long as it's free! Food here is ridiculously over-p... Phoebe: Who's hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you won't hate me?,val
Rachel Green,Hey!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,val
Rachel Green,"Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh man! I thought I got it all!,val
Rachel Green,How...how...?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"I was making a peanut butter smoothy, right?",val
Rachel Green,uh-huh.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"And I couldn't find this little plastic thing that goes on top of the blender...and I thought...well... how important can that be, right...? Turns out very!",val
Rachel Green,Wow...definitely just Drake...,val
Joey Tribbiani,What?,val
Rachel Green,What...how is it going with Drake?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh...I don't think it's going very well...,val
Rachel Green,What...that scene I saw was so good!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, I'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow...",val
Rachel Green,"Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"A little. Yeah no, I really am worried, you know, I mean I have to make it convincing that I'm in love with Olivia.",val
Rachel Green,So?,val
Joey Tribbiani,So...I've never played that!,val
Rachel Green,"Ooh! Honey, it can't be that hard, I mean, you've been in love before?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Uh...well...just once...with you...,val
Rachel Green,Ok...this could be a little awkward...I'm just going to blow past it... well can't you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance?,val
Joey Tribbiani,What the hell are you talking about??,val
Rachel Green,"Alright, alright look, just uh... just try to remember how you felt when you were in love, and think about that when you're playing the scene.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh! ok, yeah, I think I can do that. Yeah ok, there's this party scene coming up.. and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her, but he can't... And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you, but you didn't know so I would just pretend everything was cool, but really, it was killing me.",val
Rachel Green,"Joey, you never..you never talked about that before...",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Well.. hey, you know what else I could use? There's a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivia's bedroom, and she doesn't know he's there - which never happened with us! And he knows he shouldn't be there, but he just wants to look at her... you know? And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make-up, when I would think to myself, my God, she...is... beautiful... and it hurts so much, cuz I knew I could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you. Joey: Thanks dude!!!This is GREAT!! Closing credits.",val
Chandler Bing,I got you something from Vermont!,val
Monica Geller,"Besides tampons and salt? Ooh! My God! Maple candy! That's so sweet of you. That's weird...it's empty! Ross: Hi you guys! what's going on, you... you guys wanna hang out...or...? do you...do you guys hear a buzzing?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, you guys, what are you doing tomorrow night?",val
Chandler Bing,"Well, let me see... I-I believe I'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the TV.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Look, my agent hooked me up with six tickets to a great play.",val
Chandler Bing,I could fall asleep at a play.,val
Phoebe Buffay,What is it?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"It's a one-woman play called ""Why don't you like me: a bitter woman's journey through life"".",val
Monica Geller,It sounds interesting!,val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it does sound interesting, I mean, to listen to a woman complain for two hours, I don't think it gets bett...",val
Phoebe Buffay,"I know, I know, we can drive, we can vote, we can work, what more do these broads want?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"You guys are gonna have a great time, I promise!",val
Ross Geller,What? How come that you don't have to go!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"I wish I could but I just found out that I have to be at work really early the next day, so I can't go, but, you know, take the extra ticket and invite whoever you want.",val
Chandler Bing,"Uh, let's see, who do I hate?",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, sorry... Oops, sorry.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, here you go.",val
Rachel Green,"Ooh... oooh... oh, ah... Can I ask you a question?",val
Monica Geller,Yeah.,val
Rachel Green,Do you think it's possible for two friends to fool around and... and not have it be a big deal?,val
Monica Geller,"No, I don't think it ever works. Why?",val
Rachel Green,No reason.,val
Monica Geller,"No, no, Rachel?",val
Rachel Green,Yeah.,val
Monica Geller,Who do you wanna fool around with?,val
Rachel Green,"Nobody, forget it! Rachel: Maybe.",val
Monica Geller,You can't!,val
Rachel Green,Why? Seriously I did not understand a word that you said.,val
Monica Geller,In the hall.,val
Monica Geller,You wanna fool around with Joey?,val
Rachel Green,"Yeah! You know, ever since I had that dream about him, and can't get it out of my head! And what's the big deal, people do it all the time!",val
Monica Geller,Who? Who do you know that are friends that just fool around?,val
Rachel Green,"Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet.",val
Monica Geller,"Who, who are they?",val
Rachel Green,I know them from work.,val
Monica Geller,Both of them?,val
Rachel Green,"No, one of them...",val
Monica Geller,Which one?,val
Rachel Green,"I don't know, what were the names I just said?",val
Monica Geller,"Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.",val
Rachel Green,"All right, all right, you're right, I won't do anything with Joey, I just thought that we Ok so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion?",val
Monica Geller,What the hell are you cooking!,val
Ross Geller,Hey!,val
Monica Geller,Hey!,val
Chandler Bing,Hey!,val
Ross Geller,"Hey, you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today.",val
Chandler Bing,"Yes, but, Ross you chose a career of talking about dinosaurs.",val
Ross Geller,There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus.,val
Monica Geller,What's so bad about that?,val
Ross Geller,It's I just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches.,val
Monica Geller,: Ross?,val
Ross Geller,"These aren't suede. Charlie: Excuse me, I'm looking for someone. You don't, by any chance, know a Ross Geller?",val
Ross Geller,"Hi, hi, I'm Ross Geller.",val
Ross Geller,"Oh, oh, that's, that's, that's nice.",val
Ross Geller,"Oh, no, it's no big deal, I mean, if I weren't doing this I'd just, you know, be at the gym working out.",val
Monica Geller,Is he gonna introduce us?,val
Chandler Bing,"No, I think we're just blurry shapes to him now.",val
Ross Geller,"Oh, ha, I wrote that in one minute.",val
Monica Geller,Twenty bucks says they're married within the month.,val
Ross Geller,"We should probably get going, you know, we got a lot of ground to cover.",val
Ross Geller,I don't think so.,val
Ross Geller,"Oh, well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is ""if you can't come on time, then don't come at all"". An option that many of my students use. Shall we?",val
Ross Geller,"You know what, he's a big boy, I'm sure he'll find us, ok?",val
Ross Geller,"Oh, damn it!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,val
Rachel Green,Hey!,val
Joey Tribbiani,What's happenin'?,val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, it's a real shame you can't make it to that one-woman show tonight.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, I'd love to, but I gotta get up so early the next day and so, you know me, work comes first.",val

Rachel Green,"... Ok, who is this?",val
Ross Geller,"I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue.",val

Rachel Green,"Oh, no, no! I heard you before, that is so not what this is!",val

Rachel Green,Ok professor or detective?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?,val

Monica Geller,Oh my God! Chandler!,val
Chandler Bing,Where the hell is everybody? Bitter lady: Why don't you like me?! Chapter One: My first period.,val
Monica Geller,"Hey! Joey said no autographs! But if she's gettting one, then I want one too: To Monica. And none of this ""best wishes"" crap. I want ""love"".",val

Monica Geller,Oh man! If I had known I was coming to this party I never would have gotten married!,val
Rachel Green,Nice to meet you.,val
Rachel Green,Ok Monica: We will!!,val
Monica Geller,Look at you with all the guys!,val
Rachel Green,Yeah!,val
Monica Geller,I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?,val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!",val
Monica Geller,"Please... Chandler is the love of my life... ... oooh leather pants! Have Mercy! Ross: So, eh... it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave Boston, huh?",val
Ross Geller,"Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?",val
Ross Geller,You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?,val
Ross Geller,... And you called him Alby!? I mean that's like... like calling Albert Einstein... er... Alby...,val
Ross Geller,"Eh, you think? I mean, you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10!",val
Ross Geller,"Oh! like what?! Oh I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry... it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch ""Access Hollywood"".",val
Ross Geller,Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize?,val
Ross Geller,Two? Wha...? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart.,val
Ross Geller,Oh my God! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize?,val
Ross Geller,"Oh yeah? no, no Nobel Prizes for him?",val
Ross Geller,Huh... huh... what a loser! Some more wine?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Hey Ross!,val
Rachel Green,How is it going with Charlie?,val
Ross Geller,Oh Great! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my... eh. average-sized brains out.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, What's the matter?",val
Ross Geller,"She... she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners. Oh my God, at the chinese restaurant earlier today, I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth.",val
Rachel Green,I always loved that!!,val
Ross Geller,"Of course you would, your brains are smaller than mine!! Man, I can't compete with the guys she goes out with, they are so out of my league! oh my God!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Worse?,val
Ross Geller,"Oh much, much worse. I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians... ""Can we walk""? Oh, you... you like that?",val
Phoebe Buffay,No.,val
Ross Geller,What?,val
Rachel Green,Come on! I think this is funny!,val
Chandler Bing,"oh yes, God yes!!",val

Ross Geller,"Oh, I'm no actor, I'm a professor of palaeontology. Joey: It's a science.",val
Ross Geller,"Oh, well no, but I mean, she only goes out with really, really smart guys.",val
Ross Geller,"I'd lead with that. Monica: That's it, just sign right on the bra .",val
Joey Tribbiani,Monica!,val
Monica Geller,"Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year! Joey: What have you got there?",val
Ross Geller,Just some boys gave me their phone numbers.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah, let me see! Damn, that's a lot of guys! Are you a little slutty?",val
Rachel Green,I think I am.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Let me see if I approve any of these clowns. This guy wears a rug . This guy's Canadian . And this guy is in a cult, ok, and it costs you 5,000$ to get to level three and I don't feel any different. Joey: Pass, pass, oh, pass, double-pass, pass...",val
Rachel Green,"Why, why, what's wrong with these guys?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Nothing major, it's just that, you know, they're not really good enough for you, and you deserve the best.",val
Rachel Green,"Joey, you're so sweet.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"That's true. But you know what, it doesn't matter because I already know who you're gonna go home with tonight.",val
Rachel Green,Who ? Joey: Me.,val
Rachel Green,What? Really?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yes, 'cause we live together, that's a joke!",val
Rachel Green,"Oh! Screw it, I didn't get it!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Gotcha.,val
Rachel Green,"Oh, Very funny... Joey. Chandler: So, how did you enjoy the play?",val
Monica Geller,"Oh my god, honey, I'm so so so so so sorry.",val
Chandler Bing,Well you should be. You missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.,val
Monica Geller,You really liked it?,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah! I mean at first I hated it, but why wouldn't I, because as a man I've been trained not to listen! But after chapter 16: ""fat, single and ready to mingle"", I was uplifted.",val
Monica Geller,Oh really!,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh yeah, I had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! Tell me, tell me about your first period!",val
Monica Geller,No!,val
Chandler Bing,Did somebody sign your bra?,val
Monica Geller,So I got it when I was 13...,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?",val
Ross Geller,"It's actually a 1,000,000$ prize.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Go Charlie! But my point is, ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them. Maybe she's looking to, you know, slum it with some average Joe Phd.",val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, maybe. I do have my whole career in front of me. I mean, I can still win a Nobel prize. Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"You're so much more than just brains! You're sweet, and kind, and funny...",val
Ross Geller,And sexy.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Ok well give her a chance to see all of that!,val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, you're right, thanks Pheebs, I'm gonna go find her.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!",val
Ross Geller,Stop going through my stuff ! Rachel: Hey!,val
Monica Geller,Hey!,val
Rachel Green,"I just wanted to let you know I've changed my mind: I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna kiss Joey.",val
Monica Geller,"No, you can't! Friends hooking up is a bad idea.",val
Rachel Green,"Please, what about you and Chandler?",val
Monica Geller,That's different! I was drunk and stupid!,val
Rachel Green,Well hello !,val
Monica Geller,What about all the guys that you've got the phone numbers from? Why don't you just kiss one of them?,val
Rachel Green,"I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!",val
Monica Geller,Alright . I think it's a big mistake but it's your decision.,val
Rachel Green,I'm gonna do it.,val
Monica Geller,And I can't stop you.,val
Rachel Green,"No. Ross: Hey Rach, have you seen Charlie anywhere? Ross: I'm smarter than him!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler.",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and I wanted to share it with you.",val
Monica Geller,"Oh, you're so wonderful.",val
Chandler Bing,"Can't believe you guys bought that, enjoy your slow death .",val
Monica Geller,"It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night? I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie.",val
Ross Geller,"Hey, I thought I'd end up kissing Charlie too ok? But SURPRISE!",val
Chandler Bing,"I missed most of the party Charlie's a girl, right?",val
Ross Geller,"Yes, she is this new professor of my department that I did not kiss.",val
Rachel Green,"I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls at the party, GOD!",val
Ross Geller,Why do you care so much?,val
Monica Geller,"Yes Rachel, why do you care so much?",val
Rachel Green,Be-cause Ross is the father of my child! You know... and I... want him to hook up with lots of women! I just... All I'm saying is... I don't think that Joey and Charlie have anything in common.,val
Ross Geller,"Oh, I don't know, they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils...",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh, those nerds will get laaaaaid!",val
Rachel Green,"All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean...",val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, it's no big deal. I mean, I just met her and I'm fine with it...",val
Ross Geller,"Oh, God. I forgot how hot she was!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,val
Ross Geller,I'm gonna get some more coffee.,val
Ross Geller,Ok.,val
Chandler Bing,"So, a professor, uh?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! She is cool, and she's so smart! Her mind is totally acrimonious . That's not how she used it...?",val
Ross Geller,"Uhm no! Think less of you! No, I don't think less of you. I mean, you saw someone you liked and you kissed them. I mean, those people who like someone and don't kiss them... those-those people are stupid, I hate those people.",val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, I know the type.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, if you wanna grab a bite before work we'd better get acrimonious. No? Am I getting close? Opening credits.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Hey!,val
Monica Geller,Hey!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Hey you guys! Look what I just got.,val
Rachel Green,"Oh, OH! Wow, I love those! Where did you get them?",val
Phoebe Buffay,I bought them off Ebay! They used to belong to the late Shania Twain.,val
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, Shania Twain is still alive!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh... then I overpaid.,val
Monica Geller,"Hey, what's this?",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, it's a gift certificate to this new SPA in SOHO.",val
Monica Geller,"Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage chains.",val
Rachel Green,"Ah, why, now I can't get a massage? There are so many things that she disapproves of! I can't eat veal, I can't wear fur, I can't go hunting...",val
Monica Geller,Do you wanna go hunting?,val
Rachel Green,"Well, I would like to have the option!!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"What's up? Hey, Rachel!!",val
Rachel Green,Oh!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"No, you can't go there! You know how I feel about these ""big massage places""! They're putting people like me out of business!",val
Monica Geller,"And she wants to go hunting, too!!",val
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing away a hundred bucks!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, this is not about the MONEY, ok? It's about... it's about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us... the hollow shells.",val
Rachel Green,I don't care about any of that!!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, do you care about friendship?",val
Rachel Green,Oh!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Promise?,val
Rachel Green,I promise.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Thank you.,val
Rachel Green,But I am going hunting!!,val
Monica Geller,Hey honey! I missed you today!,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah?",val
Monica Geller,Yeah. What d'you wanna do tonight?,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, well... Maybe we could...",val
Monica Geller,"Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess? Know your audience! Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank.",val
Chandler Bing,We really need to take those tests?,val
Monica Geller,"Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year. I think it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.",val
Chandler Bing,But I don't wanna do it in a cup!,val
Monica Geller,What is the big deal?,val
Chandler Bing,It's weird! In a doctor's office?,val
Monica Geller,It's not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a Taco Bell?,val
Chandler Bing,"I cannot believe Ross told you that! And in my defense, it was a Wendy's!",val
Monica Geller,"Look, I don't wanna do this test either, but I really do think it's a good idea!",val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, ok. I'm sure that doctor's office can't be worst than on a class trip to the Hershey's factory!",val
Monica Geller,OH!,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah! RACHEL TALKS TOO!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Who says that wine has to cost more than milk!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Heeey!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on in, how are ya?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Can I offer you a drink?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh-oh. I hade a pretty hectic day at work too, today I had to open a door and go ohhhh!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, if you need a tour guide...",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, definitely, definitely. Ok, what do you wanna see first?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Ok!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, yeah!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, let me stop you right there. The Mets suck, ok? You wanna see the Yankees.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Which one, they all suck!",val
Joey Tribbiani,I don't think so.,val
Rachel Green,Hi there!,val
Rachel Green,"Oh, hi. I have a massage appointment under Rachel Green, and here is my gift certificate.",val
Rachel Green,And... taped back together.,val
Rachel Green,Ok.,val
Rachel Green,through the glass doors.,val
Rachel Green,Alright-y then.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok. Do we have to talk like that then they're not around? Oh, no, no! Listen, is there someone who can fill in for me?",val
Phoebe Buffay,But that woman can't know I work here. She's a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are.,val
Phoebe Buffay,'Cause it's good money! But that doesn't change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, are they listening?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Ross!,val
Ross Geller,Hi!,val
Joey Tribbiani,I need to talk to you about Charlie.,val
Ross Geller,"Oh, do you, do you really?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, I'm... I'm kind of having a little problem.",val
Ross Geller,"Look, if you don't know what the word ""acrimonious"" means, just don't use it!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, look, you know Charlie, right? She's cool, she's funny, her body is soo...",val
Ross Geller,Get to the problem!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Yes. It's just that she's so much smarter than all the girls I've ever dated! Combined! I don't want her to think I'm stupid!,val
Ross Geller,Are you wearing two belts?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"EH, what do you know!",val
Ross Geller,You were saying you didn't want to seem stupid.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Right, right, right, well, she wants to go to all this cultural places and I don't know how to talk about that stuff. You gotta help me out!",val
Ross Geller,"You know, I really don't want to get involved in you guy's relationship.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Please, c'mon, you're the smartest person I know and I really like this girl, ok, I don't wanna lose her.",val
Ross Geller,Fine.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Thanks.,val
Ross Geller,"Ok. Let's see. Oh, you should take her to the MET!",val
Joey Tribbiani,The Metsss!,val
Ross Geller,"Oh, no! The MET! The Metropolitan Museum of Art.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, that's what she meant! You know, if they're gonna shorten it, they should call it the MUSE! You know, short for museum, and avoid all the confusion!",val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, all right, so I'll take her to the MET.",val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, uh, uh, ok, there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue. You know what? She loves architecture, you know what you should do? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Geez, sounds like you should be going on this date!",val
Ross Geller,But I'm not! . You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food...,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down, you go way too fast. Ok? Just go back to the MET, ok?",val
Ross Geller,Ok.,val
Joey Tribbiani,You got to tell me exactly what to do there.,val
Ross Geller,"Ok, when you walk in the museum, take the right, that's the antiquities wing. Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, up to the Byzantine Empire.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! So, I walk in the door and make the right.",val
Chandler Bing,I have a weird feeling about this place. How do I know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.,val
Monica Geller,"Because, honey, I mean this in the sweetest way possible, nobody is gonna wanna watch that.",val
Chandler Bing,"Deposit my specimen? You know, usually I have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk. Thanks, got it.",val
Monica Geller,"Hey, honey, my test is down the hall, are you sure you're going to be ok?",val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, I guess!",val
Monica Geller,"I know this is embarrassing, but nobody cares! No one here even knows you!",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, Come on!",val
Monica Geller,"Hey, we're probably fertile, let's go home!",val
Chandler Bing,Why are you here?,val
Chandler Bing,"No no no... I mean, why? why is she here??",val
Chandler Bing,What!?,val
Monica Geller,This was fun! But I've got an invasive vaginal exam to get to!,val
Chandler Bing,"I'd love to stay, but I have eh... got a hot date...",val
Chandler Bing,I think it just fell off.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hello ""ja"", it's time for your massage, ja! Put your face in the hole.",val
Rachel Green,"Wow, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, then I'm Swedish...",val
Monica Geller,"So, what's your name?",val
Phoebe Buffay,It's a normal Swedish name... Ikea...,val
Rachel Green,Oh... what an interesting name.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Ja!,val
Rachel Green,You know I...,val
Phoebe Buffay,Time for your scalp massage!,val
Rachel Green,Wow... I really love your...,val
Phoebe Buffay,Is something wrong?,val
Rachel Green,"No, it's just that uhm... it feels so good... Ikea... Yeah, say hey, you'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?",val
Phoebe Buffay,Uhm... Stockholm.,val
Rachel Green,Damn! I wish I knew if that was right!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas. Monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself.,val
Ross Geller,"Now, do you have any idea what you just said?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, my mouth says the words, my brain is thinking monster trucks!",val
Ross Geller,"Ok now, remember, when you get to the museum, Monet is not spelt M-O-N-A-Y. I just... I wrote that out phonetically for you.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Phonetically?,val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, yeah that means... you know? We just... we don't have time for this.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Ok.,val
Ross Geller,"Ok, but you know what? I gotta say, I'm really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ah! I'm an actor! I can memorize anything! Last week on ""Days"" I had to say ""Frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy"".",val
Ross Geller,Wow. What does that mean?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"No idea! But the guy I said it to dies in the next scene so I guess it means ""you're gonna get eaten by a bear"".",val
Ross Geller,Ok! So let's move on to the Renaissance?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, Caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure. Touch it, it's really bumpy! .",val
Ross Geller,"Nah ah! Nah ah! No no no! No ad-libbing and dude, you can't touch the paintings.",val
Joey Tribbiani,Come on! you...,val
Ross Geller,No!,val
Chandler Bing,My specimen is in the room and I just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while I was in there. Really helped speed the process along! Janice! You're not... gone?,val
Chandler Bing,Yeah! yeah... The hard part is over!,val
Chandler Bing,I haven't... I haven't even thought about the results yet... I just assumed that everything was gonna be ok.,val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, but what if it's not? What if there is a reason why we can't have a baby?",val
Chandler Bing,"oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. I can't believe I didn't even think of that. I guess I was just so worried about having to... come here and do... 'that'...",val
Chandler Bing,"It was a ""Wendy's!! """,val
Phoebe Buffay,"""Ipan Stripan, Glupi Glabi! "" And that is the Swedish National Anthem! Thank you for asking!",val
Rachel Green,"Wow, Ikea... what a rich culture. Uhm, you know what? I have a friend who is a masseuse.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, Ja! Ja!",val
Rachel Green,Yah! She's... uhm... not very good though...,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Uhu, uhu... and why do you think that is?",val
Rachel Green,I don't know... maybe it's because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar...,val
Phoebe Buffay,Or... maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high maintenance tight ass!,val
Rachel Green,Phoebe!!,val
Phoebe Buffay,You know it's me?,val
Rachel Green,"For like a half an hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!",val
Phoebe Buffay,How can you come here?,val
Rachel Green,How could you not tell me you worked here?,val
Phoebe Buffay,I don't have to tell you everything!,val
Rachel Green,"Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Tips not included.,val
Rachel Green,"Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Because I was ashamed ok? I sold out for the cash! And then they give me benefits like medical, and dental, and a 401K. But you know... you pay a price. Now I'm this Corporate stooge and punching a clock and Ugh! paying taxes!",val
Rachel Green,"Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!",val
Phoebe Buffay,You know what? You are right. I am gonna quit. It's time I took my life back!,val
Rachel Green,Good for you Pheebs!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Ok.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay If you guys have microphones in there too, I didn't mean any of that. I love you.",val
Ross Geller,"Haha! Got ya! Die, die, die!",val
Ross Geller,"Respectfully, professor R. Geller. , closes the laptop and joins Charlie on the sofa) Hey!",val
Ross Geller,"Hey, how was the Met?",val
Ross Geller,"Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?",val
Ross Geller,What do you mean?,val
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute... when you guys walked into the Met, did you go to the right?",val
Ross Geller,"Oh Joey, Joey! But still, I mean, it seems like you guys are having a great time together.",val
Ross Geller,What?,val
Ross Geller,"What, I mean, a little, but no, what, go on.",val
Ross Geller,"Yeah. But you know what? I think you should give Joey a chance. I mean, he's a great guy, and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know, you can always talk about that with someone else.",val
Ross Geller,"And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You know, that's the kind of guy Joey is.",val
Ross Geller,That was going to be my next argument.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,val
Ross Geller,Hey!,val
Joey Tribbiani,You're ready?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey Ross! That art stuff worked, you hooked me up.",val
Ross Geller,Glad I could help man.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Although some of that stuff wasn't where you said it was gonna be, but... I made it work.",val
Chandler Bing,It is not okay that I'm aroused by this now.,val
Chandler Bing,"Hello? Oh hi, Doctor Connelly. No, she's not here but, you know, I can tell her. Should I be sitting down for this? Oh. Well, so what does that mean? Ok. Ok, thank you. Thanks.",val
Monica Geller,Hey sweetie.,val
Chandler Bing,Doctor Connelly just called.,val
Monica Geller,"With good news? Of course it is not good news, you just said ""Doctor Connelly just called"". If it was good news you would have said ""Doctor Connelly just called! "" But so what is it? Is there a problem, uh? Is there a problem with me or with you?",val
Chandler Bing,Actually it's both of us.,val
Monica Geller,What?,val
Chandler Bing,Apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment.,val
Monica Geller,Oh... what does that mean?,val
Chandler Bing,It means that my guys won't get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do. It means...,val
Monica Geller,Chandler?,val
Chandler Bing,"It means that we can keep trying, but there's a good chance this may never happen for us.",val
Monica Geller,Oh my God!,val
Chandler Bing,I'm sorry.,val
Monica Geller,I'm sorry too.,val
Chandler Bing,"Well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.",val
Monica Geller,I know. Closing credits.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Good morning receptionist.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Rachel Green? Son of a bitch, she came back?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Are you ready for your Scottish massage? Put your face in the hole, lassy.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, lucky me! Coffee and a live sex show!",val
Rachel Green,"Oh... Oh, I'm sorry! I'm not... I was just-I was just reading to Emma.",val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, yeah... It's... ""climax your way to better skin"".",val
Joey Tribbiani,"So you need someone who knows fashion, to tell you what looks good.",val
Rachel Green,"Not me, not me, not me, not me, not me!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh hey Rach!,val
Rachel Green,Yeah...,val
Joey Tribbiani,Maybe you could take Charlie shopping.,val
Rachel Green,"Oh, well...",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes.",val
Rachel Green,"Ok, uh-uh... Let's-Let's shop!!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, you're gonna come back with some very classy clothes... ... and some slutty lingerie, SLUTTY!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, great! All right, bye! Pain in the ass!! That's off, right?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"What's the matter, Pheebs?",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh... Mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight, he's gonna be there. And she was like ""Oh, don't worry! I asked him. He's totally ok with seeing you!"". So now I have to go so he'll think that I'm totally ok with seeing him!",val
Rachel Green,"Which you're not, because you've totally hung up on him!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Exactly!,val
Rachel Green,And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"I didn't even think about that! Aaargh, sexual politics!!",val
Rachel Green,"Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok, that'll be great!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, ain't that nice? The three of you trying on slutty lingerie together.",val
Rachel Green,That's not what we're gonna do!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Why would you ruin it, who was that hurtin'?",val
Chandler Bing,Wow! Fortunately she has a very pretty face!,val
Monica Geller,"Oh, I so can't believe this! My uterus is an inhospitable environment? I was trying so hard to be a good hostess!",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, I can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when I was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!",val
Chandler Bing,Hi.,val
Monica Geller,Hi.,val
Monica Geller,Ok.,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, DAMN IT!",val
Monica Geller,"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out.",val
Monica Geller,Ok.,val
Chandler Bing,"Is that a hint? Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we don't think we'd want you to be our child! Wow, talking about an inhospitable environment!",val
Rachel Green,"Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, have a good time.",val
Rachel Green,Not gonna find any clothes in there!,val
Ross Geller,"Hey, you guys!",val
Rachel Green,Hi.,val
Ross Geller,Guess who's up for keynote speaker at the National Paleontology Conference?,val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, right! What was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract Well, why are you laughing?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Just... seeing what it'd be like to be a paleontologist... it's fun, yeah!",val
Ross Geller,"Professor Sherman, yeah. I've a meeting with him today.",val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, well... I think I know how to dazzle him.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh... you're not gonna do a magic trick, are ya?",val
Ross Geller,Tsz... NO! .,val
Chandler Bing,Hey guys!,val
Ross Geller,"Wait a minute, you guys. Oh, I wanna ask you something. I-I I may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if I do, I'd love for you guys to come and hear me.",val
Chandler Bing,"I think I can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.",val
Ross Geller,It's in Barbados.,val
Chandler Bing,But you come first!,val
Rachel Green,I'm there!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Bye.,val
Rachel Green,"Bye, see ya.",val
Chandler Bing,Ok.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, so. How did it go at the fertility clinic?",val
Chandler Bing,Not as much fun as last time. Apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.,val
Ross Geller,So-so what did the doctor say?,val
Chandler Bing,"Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.",val
Joey Tribbiani,So you're ruling out surrogacy?,val
Chandler Bing,Yeah.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"So, I don't have to learn what that means?",val
Chandler Bing,"Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Enough said, I'm there for you man. Where is she, upstairs?",val
Chandler Bing,ah-ha!,val
Ross Geller,How do you feel about all this?,val
Chandler Bing,I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don't think there is one.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!",val
Ross Geller,What?,val
Ross Geller,What? NO! I am not going to give them Ben!,val
Ross Geller,The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are - are staggering.,val
Ross Geller,"I mean, we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given, but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can - you can just throw most of our assumptions, you know, right in the trash. So-so what I am saying is - is is that is that the repercussions could be huge! I mean, not just in palaeontology, but if-if you think about it, in evolutionary biology, uh, genetics, geology, uh, I mean, truly the mind boggles!",val
Ross Geller,"Oh, that's not what you want...",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I'll take some of that.",val
Rachel Green,"Pheebs, that's for men!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"No, I know, this way when I go to the party later Mike will know I am over him cause I'm gonna smell like another guy. Yeah.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. . Seriously does anyone buy this? I smell like beets!",val
Rachel Green,"On Melanie Griffith in ""Working girl"". I think what you want is over here.",val
Rachel Green,Really?,val
Rachel Green,"Oh, I can't. Because I-I've seen them.",val
Rachel Green,"Yeah! I'm a big fan! Of the movies, you know. Motion pictures. The Talkies!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Hey Rach, will you come with me to a dressing room?",val
Rachel Green,Sure!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Ok!,val
Rachel Green,You know that depends on what it is! I've done a lot of stuff.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"So what were you doing out there, do you not like Charlie?",val
Rachel Green,"She's ok, I just don't get a really good vibe from her!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Why?,val
Rachel Green,"I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Who else?,val
Rachel Green,"Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom...",val
Phoebe Buffay,You like Joey?,val
Rachel Green,"Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!,val
Rachel Green,"It's just physical and I have it totally under control! Ok? It's just, when I see them together, sometimes I just get a little jealous!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Uh, wow! Isn't it ironic that he liked you and now you like him?",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, I get it!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh well, as long as it is under control, you know, you can't do anything about it, he's already dating her, and she is a nice person, that wouldn't be right.",val
Rachel Green,"I know, I know, so it is just not a big deal.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.,val
Rachel Green,So can we keep this between us?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Sure!,val
Rachel Green,"Ok, great, because I gotta get out of here, the smell of beets is killing me!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?,val
Monica Geller,Hi honey!,val
Chandler Bing,"Hey! Look I brought a friend for dinner, this is Zack, from work!",val
Monica Geller,"Oh, of course, it's so nice to see you again, Zack!",val
Chandler Bing,"You guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! You're both polite! Go to have a seat Zack, and I'll get you a beer.",val
Monica Geller,I got it.,val
Chandler Bing,"So, Zack's pretty nice, uh?",val
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I guess.",val
Chandler Bing,"So, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!",val
Monica Geller,Excuse me?,val
Chandler Bing,"Well, we're talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy! I mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, I mean, he is ""spermtastic""!",val
Monica Geller,"Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! ""Come up, meet my wife! Give us your sperm""!",val
Chandler Bing,"No, I invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! I mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.",val
Monica Geller,Chandler!,val
Chandler Bing,"I'm telling you, he's great! I mean, even if my sperm worked fine, I'd think he'd be the way to go!",val
Monica Geller,I'm not going to be a part of this! You can't just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor!,val
Chandler Bing,Ok!,val
Monica Geller,Uh!,val
Chandler Bing,Zack!,val
Monica Geller,"Tell me about yourself, Zack!",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, God, do you think she heard? It would be so bad if she heard!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, maybe she didn't hear! Ok I'm gonna go into that dressing room, you stay in here and I'll talk and see if you can hear me.",val
Rachel Green,"Ok, great!",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, thank God I can't hear a word that you're saying!",val
Phoebe Buffay,I didn't say anything yet!,val
Rachel Green,"Well, get back in there and talk!",val
Phoebe Buffay,I'm Rachel. It's so annoying when I put Emma on the phone to talk with my friends.,val
Rachel Green,What!?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, some things are just hard to say to your face.",val
Rachel Green,"Ok well, I heard that! Which means that she heard it too!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Ooh! We have a problem.,val
Rachel Green,Oh! What are we gonna do?,val
Rachel Green,Oh my God!,val
Rachel Green,Alright! Enough out of you!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Hello?,val
Ross Geller,"Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?",val
Joey Tribbiani,No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?,val
Ross Geller,I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker...,val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! How's it going?,val
Ross Geller,"It could be better! He, uhm... he fell asleep!",val
Joey Tribbiani,What!? But I already bought my ticket to Bermuda!,val
Ross Geller,Barbados.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!",val
Ross Geller,What am I supposed to do? He's out cold! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, just wake him up!",val
Ross Geller,"I can't! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep, I won't get the job!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh! That's a tough one. Oh! Wait a minute, this happened to me before! Yeah, I was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and... no wait a minute... it was me who fell asleep... Yeah I mean hey, Shakespeare, how about a chase scene once in a while!?",val
Monica Geller,Hey guys! Dinner's ready!,val
Chandler Bing,"So what do you think? I want that guys genes for my kid! Those eyes, those cheeckbones!",val
Monica Geller,"Ok, there's enthusiastic and there's just plain gay!!",val
Chandler Bing,You don't like him.,val
Monica Geller,I think he is fine! It's just that we don't know anything real about him... we should get more information.,val
Chandler Bing,Alright! Just follow my lead!,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh! Thanks, I'm crazy about our place. Hey! speaking of crazy... do you have a history of mental illness in the family?",val
Chandler Bing,That's really not the kind of thing we are looking for Zack.,val
Monica Geller,"Oh, friends first, drunk in London, you know the story. I've got a better question for you: Do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes?",val
Monica Geller,"Eh... Heart Disease, Alzheimers, gout?",val
Monica Geller,We're just making conversation.,val
Chandler Bing,You know what's not funny? Male Pattern Baldness.,val
Chandler Bing,I noticed you were enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. Did you have braces as a child?,val
Monica Geller,Yess!!,val
Chandler Bing,We're teeth people Zack!,val
Rachel Green,Alright! Let's just do it. Let's just go over there and see if she heard.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Good plan.,val
Rachel Green,Ok. Wha...? where? Where are you going?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at ""who's more over who""!",val
Rachel Green,"Hey, hi! Hey, where've you been?",val
Rachel Green,"Oh! Wi... in the dres... in the dressing room!? Well, that's so weird! Phoebe and I were just trying on clothes in the dressing room. God it's just such a small world!",val
Rachel Green,"Oh God. You did. You heard. Ok, listen, let me explain.",val
Rachel Green,Yeah.,val
Rachel Green,"Yeah! That's Phoebe. That's Phoebe. You know, she just wants them all! It's like she's a nympho!",val
Rachel Green,Yeah...,val
Rachel Green,I try...,val
Ross Geller,Oh my God! You really want me to be the keynote speaker? Thank you!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Wow! You look... ... stop-eating hot! Which is like the highest level of hotness!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Are you sure? Because I'm really dreading going to this party.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Then don't go!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Mike knows I'm coming, and if I don't show up he'll think it's because of him! And I don't want to lose face! That's a very serious thing in my culture.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, then you go to that party and you pretend to be over Mike. And afterward you come to my place and I'll get you good and drunk!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"You got it! Ok. But not on the wine that you made, ok, because I just don't want to go back to the Emergency Room.",val
Phoebe Buffay,David?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Oh my God!,val
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah. What-what are you doing here?,val
Phoebe Buffay,What happened?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, it's great that you're back! How are you?",val
Phoebe Buffay,Good!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, good for you.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Mike and I broke up.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Really?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"I understand. Yeah. Ok so then ok, so we're both living in New York, not seeing anyone. That's so not like us!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Well... no.,val
Phoebe Buffay,I'd love to.,val
Phoebe Buffay,Ok.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, got it, stay upwind of me.",val
Rachel Green,"No, that's David.",val
Rachel Green,Tip of the iceberg.,val
Chandler Bing,You sure you don't wanna stick around a little longer?,val
Chandler Bing,"Are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.",val
Chandler Bing,Ok.,val
Chandler Bing,I think we've found our sperm!,val
Monica Geller,Does seem pretty perfect.,val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, you think so, well? Should I ask him?",val
Monica Geller,No.,val
Chandler Bing,"Why not, just because his great-grandmother was obese, our kids are gonna get that from you anyway!",val
Monica Geller,"No, that's not it. It's just that when we were asking him all those questions before, I just... I just realized I don't care if he's the most perfect guy in the world... he's not you.",val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, he's better!",val
Monica Geller,"No, he's not. And if I can't get pregnant with you, then I don't want to get pregnant by... him or anyone else.",val
Chandler Bing,Really? Are you sure?,val
Monica Geller,"Yeah, I'm sure.",val
Chandler Bing,"Thank God, because I don't wanna do this either. You know, I was just doing because I thought that was what you wanted to do. You know, I'm the husband, I'm supposed to... bring the sperm.",val
Monica Geller,That is so sweet. I love you.,val
Chandler Bing,So you know this leaves us with...,val
Monica Geller,Adoption.,val
Chandler Bing,How do you feel about that?,val
Monica Geller,I think I feel ok about it. Actually I think I feel really good about it.,val
Chandler Bing,Me too. I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you. And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way.,val
Monica Geller,"So this is it, we're really gonna adopt?",val
Chandler Bing,Yeah.,val
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, we're gonna be parents!",val
Chandler Bing,We are gonna be great parents.,val
Monica Geller,"And it could be soon. I mean, think about it: right now, somewhere out there our baby could be being conceived.",val
Chandler Bing,"Wait, if we're lucky, and we're really really really quiet, we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking!",val
Chandler Bing,"Hey, Zack!",val
Chandler Bing,"Look, I just wanted to apologize for last night. I got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable.",val
Chandler Bing,Really?,val
Chandler Bing,"My wife and I have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. We're working on it.",val
Chandler Bing,"You wouldn't know if Jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey! I'm all packed and ready to go!,val
Ross Geller,"Oh, that's right! Daddy and uncle Joey are going on a trip today. We're going to a conference in Barbados, right?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Mmh-mmh.,val
Ross Geller,Can you say Barbados?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Barbados!,val
Ross Geller,"Ok, I gotta say. I mean, it means so much to me that you guys are coming all the way over there to hear me do my speech! UH! And I've a surprise, uh... I had to pull some strings but I was able to get everyone passes to the entire conference! That's right! This babies will get you into all the paleontology lectures and seminars.",val
Rachel Green,Do you have anything that would... get us out of them?,val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah Ross, I mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, ""island's stuff"".",val
Phoebe Buffay,I think David would probably wanna hear a few lectures.,val
Ross Geller,"Oh, right, because he's a scientist!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"No, no, because, you know, he's been in Minsk for 8 years and if he gets too much direct sunlight, he'll die.",val
Ross Geller,"Ok, we gotta go, yeah? So, we'll see you guys tomorrow.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"All right, let's do it! 5 hour flight with Charlie, have a couple of drinks, get under that blanket and do what comes naturally.",val
Ross Geller,"It's a blanket Joe, not a cloak of invisibility!",val
Ross Geller,Look at all these paleontologists!!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, there are gonna be some pasty folks by the pool tomorrow!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"I think I've been recognized, this happens all the time!",val
Joey Tribbiani,That... never happens...,val
Ross Geller,"Wow! This is very flattering, uh...",val
Ross Geller,"Uh, uh... Sure! Uhm... ""Dear...""",val
Ross Geller,"""... Sarah. I dig you"", Uh? ""Doctor Ross Geller"".",val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, oh and Sarah... I'd like to introduce you to my colleague, uh, Professor Wheeler, a-and this is Joey Tribbiani.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, God, no! No! No no, I'm an actor. You'd probably recognize me from a little show called ""The Days of Our Lives"".",val
Ross Geller,"Dude, it's just ""Days of Our Lives""... there's no the.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, Ross! It's... It's fun, yeah! No, I-I play Doctor Drake Ramoray.",val
Joey Tribbiani,You don't own a TV? What's all your furniture pointed at??,val
Monica Geller,"David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.",val
Monica Geller,See?,val
Chandler Bing,"Yeah, that's the same as ""it has something to do with wind"".",val
Monica Geller,"Alright, I'm gonna go pick up a few things for the trip.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, I should go, too. Oh, now... tomorrow do you guys wanna share a cab to the airport or should Mike and I just meet you there.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Mike?? Who's Mike?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"That's right! Oh, yeah... Well, I've totally forgotten about im! AH! That's-That's... a blast from the past!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard all the time!",val
Chandler Bing,She does?,val
Monica Geller,Let's get you out of here!!,val
Monica Geller,At least you took me down with you!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why-Why do I miss Mike? That's-that's gonna go away, right?",val
Monica Geller,"I guess, in time.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah.,val
Monica Geller,"I mean, my feelings for Richard are certainly gone.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"You just did it again. Chandler, your feelings for Chandler are certainly gone!",val
Chandler Bing,I wouldn't read too much into it.,val
Chandler Bing,"David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.",val
Chandler Bing,"Seriously, we're gonna do this?",val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, because his penis was too big. Oh, I'm sorry, that's the kind of thing I do. They broke up because Mike didn't want to get married. Hey, what if you just let Phoebe know you'd be open to marriage?",val
Chandler Bing,What?,val
Chandler Bing,I didn't mean now...,val
Chandler Bing,"Well, you're welcome! Glad I could help.",val
Chandler Bing,"David, I'm pretending to read here!!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah! How you doin'? Yeah alright!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey, hey! You said you're gonna wear a thong, where's the thong?",val
Joey Tribbiani,You really should have been more clear about that!,val
Ross Geller,Hey!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey!,val
Ross Geller,You're never going to guess who I just saw downstairs!,val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! ah! eh... Britney Spears!?,val
Ross Geller,"Yeah, she never misses these conferences! No, I just saw Dr. Kenneth Schwartz!",val
Ross Geller,Yeah... what am I going to say to Kenneth Schwartz?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"You could say: ""Hey Kenny, how come you're not Britney Spears?""",val
Ross Geller,Ready to go?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Wha...? You're gonna go now? I thought we could hang out?,val
Ross Geller,Yeah.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Will you wear a thong?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh... you got yourself a very weird deal!,val
Ross Geller,"I'm good, I have dinner plans .",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, yeah. I've got tons of stuff I could do. I'm gonna hit the beach, go swimming...",val
Ross Geller,"Uh, Joe, have you looked outside?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, why?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh man!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"I wasn't gonna swim, I was gonna dig a hole!",val
Monica Geller,Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.,val
Chandler Bing,"I do! Want a hint? huh? ""I do"" ""I do"".",val
Monica Geller,"Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.",val
Chandler Bing,David is going to propose to Phoebe.,val
Monica Geller,What? Why?,val
Chandler Bing,"Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.",val
Monica Geller,"Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?",val
Chandler Bing,"I did! A penis one! Look, just so I know, what was so wrong about what I said?",val
Monica Geller,"They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say ""No"", David's heart will be broken, it will be too hard for them to recover from and then Phoebe will end up alone again.",val
Chandler Bing,"Man, that's some bad advice!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Oh! Hey! Thank God you guys are here!,val
Rachel Green,Hey! Hey what's going on?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Everything is upside down here! It rains all day long, nobody watches tv and Ross is famous!",val
Rachel Green,"Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!",val
Monica Geller,"Ok! When I go places with high humidity, it gets a little extra body, ok?!",val
Chandler Bing,That's why our honeymoon photos look like me and Diana Ross!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on, I'll show you guys where to check in.",val
Monica Geller,"Oh, honey, can you make sure we get a King size bed!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh! David, get one for us too! Oh, oh, and see if they have a heart-shaped one! And with mirrors on the ceiling!",val
Monica Geller,And make sure our room isn't next to theirs .,val
Rachel Green,"Ooh! You guys are so lucky you are here with people, you known it's such a romantic place. That's all, I just wish I could share that with a guy.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Not Joey.,val
Rachel Green,"Not Joey, no, I was just lusting after Chandler.",val
Monica Geller,"Yeah, right!",val
Chandler Bing,"Tonight?! Isn't an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond? Oh, there it is!",val
Chandler Bing,Nice!,val
Chandler Bing,"Monica, can I talk to you for a sec?",val
Monica Geller,Ok!,val
Chandler Bing,David is going to propose to Phoebe tonight!,val
Monica Geller,See what happens when you give people advice? I hope you told him not to?,val
Chandler Bing,That would be advice!!,val
Monica Geller,Ok fine. I'll handle this. Phoebe?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Yeah?,val
Monica Geller,I need to talk to you.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Are you leaving ""The Supremes""?",val
Monica Geller,"Ok, my husband just gave your boyfriend some very bad advice. Look, David is going to propose to you tonight.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Wow? Really? That's fantastic!,val
Monica Geller,What are you serious? You wanna marry him? Wha... What about Mike?,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh, ok, you want me to marry Mike? Alright, well, let's just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle. I can just see it: ""Mike, do you take Phoebe..."" You know, it's every girl's dream!",val
Monica Geller,Do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer?,val

Ross Geller,I can't believe this. I can't believe this is happening. I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow! Ok? I have to stand up in front of all these people. What am I gonna say?,val
Joey Tribbiani,I could teach you a speech that I memorized for auditions.,val

Joey Tribbiani,"Hey don't worry about that! I mean, Ross needs you! And Rachel and I will stay and help anyway we can.",val
Rachel Green,Ugh.,val
Ross Geller,"Alright, ok, let's do it. Uhm, I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating... uhm, and then, then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era, the breakup of Pangea, hello! And then, there's the... eh... there's the overview of the Triassic.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, oh! Any chance any of this happened in a ""Galaxy far, far away""? .",val
Monica Geller,"Ok, Mike, enough is enough, now you love Phoebe and she loves you, so you need to get over your whole ""I never want to get married"" thing and step up!",val
Monica Geller,"This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say ""yes"" but I know she really wants to be with you!",val
Monica Geller,"I... I'm sorry, did you say something? I can't hear through all this damned hair!",val
Monica Geller,"You don't tell me what to do! I tell you what to do! Just call her. She's at the Paradise Hotel in Barbados. And while I've got you, you've got curly hair. What do you do in humidity? Damnit!",val
Monica Geller,"Well, I hope you're happy!",val
Chandler Bing,"Oooh! I hope you're happy too, honey!",val
Monica Geller,"Phoebe is going to say ""Yes"" to David. See, that's what happens when you meddle in people's lives!",val
Chandler Bing,"Phoebe is going to say ""yes""? That's, that's great!",val
Monica Geller,"No it's not, b'cause she's still in love with Mike!",val
Chandler Bing,And there's not chance that will work?,val
Monica Geller,"No, I called him. It's not gonna happen.",val
Chandler Bing,Oooooooh! Meddler! Meddler!,val
Monica Geller,"Well, if you hadn't meddled to start with, I wouldn't have had to go in there and meddle myself. Now, no matter how much we meddle, we will never be able to un-meddle the thing that you meddled up - in the first place!",val
Chandler Bing,This vacation sucks!!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm so bored! Stupid rain, we... we can't do anything.",val

Ross Geller,No.,val
Ross Geller,"Oh, it was... it's complicated, you know? She... she was... eh... gay.",val
Ross Geller,"Ok, odd thing to get excited about!",val
Ross Geller,Hey! High-five!,val
Ross Geller,My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year. She didn't get any fitter.,val
Ross Geller,"I know! It's like, if you knew, why didn't you tell me, you know? I mean, call, or leave a note: ""Hi, I just dropped by to say your wife's gay""",val
Ross Geller,"And then, you try to make the best of a bad situation, so you float the idea of a threesome?",val
Ross Geller,Me neither.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Well, who knew? Pharmacists are fun.",val
Rachel Green,"I know, that old lady at the end was ready to take you home.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Not enough pills in the world, Rach. What about you, you're the single one, seen anybody in there you like?",val
Rachel Green,"Well, let's see. There was a really big guy that I was talking to, with the really nice breasts...",val
Joey Tribbiani,"But what about back home, anything going on there? Anybody you like?",val
Rachel Green,No.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"There it is, you're blushing!",val
Rachel Green,"No, I'm not blushing, I'm sunburnt! From, you know, the rain.",val
Joey Tribbiani,You like someone. Tell me who it is. Who is it?,val
Rachel Green,No.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Tell me who it is.,val
Rachel Green,Joey!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Come on who? Who do you like? Tell me. You're not getting away that easy. Who do you like, who?",val
Rachel Green,"Joey, come on! It doesn't matter, you know, it's not like anything's gonna happen.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"What? Why not? Rach, who can you not get?",val
Rachel Green,"Oh! Ok. Ok, you really wanna know who it is?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, who is that?",val
Rachel Green,Do ya?,val
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Right, of course. Hey, did you guys finish the speech?",val
Ross Geller,"Yep, we got it, we got it. Thank you so much.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, hey look, and this isn't over, because I really wanna know who...",val
Rachel Green,Later! La...,val
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah.,val
Rachel Green,"Ok. See you, bye.",val
Ross Geller,Good night.,val
Joey Tribbiani,Night.,val
Monica Geller,I can't believe she's gonna say yes to David. She's clearly in love with Mike.,val
Chandler Bing,"You know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.",val
Monica Geller,"Oh my God, he's gonna do it now. Please, I cannot watch this, let's go.",val
Chandler Bing,"I think we have some time. Have you ever heard him talk? ""Uh, Phoebe, uh, I would be honoured, uh..."" Spit it out, David!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Sure, ok, yeah.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Oh my God, Mike!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"No, Mike's here.",val
Monica Geller,IT'S THE HUMIDITY!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"What are you, what are you doing here?",val
Monica Geller,"You're the most incredible woman I've ever met. How can I lose you? Now, I don't actually have a ring...",val
Chandler Bing,"I wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.",val
Phoebe Buffay,No!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"I love you. But I never needed a proposal from you. I just needed to know that we were headed somewhere, you know, that we had a future.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry.",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I might have said yes, but that would have been wrong.",val
Phoebe Buffay,Yes!,val
Monica Geller,BECAUSE OF OUR MEDDLING! Alright?,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, ain't this nice? It's so quiet, I could just lie here all day.",val
Monica Geller,I know.,val
Rachel Green,Open your drapes! Open your drapes!,val
Chandler Bing,I'm so glad we've got adjoining rooms!,val
Monica Geller,The sun is out!,val
Chandler Bing,Hey! Remember when I had corneas?,val
Monica Geller,"Ok listen, you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs, and I'll get the magazines and the lotion.",val
Chandler Bing,Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.,val
Rachel Green,Nooo!,val
Monica Geller,Damn it!,val
Ross Geller,"Walls are pretty thin, guys!",val
Ross Geller,Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating.,val
Rachel Green,"Look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan... so leathery and wrinkled, I'm so jealous!",val
Ross Geller,"Finally, factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered: Gigantosaurus, Argentinasaurus...",val
Chandler Bing,Not to mention the cold sores.,val
Ross Geller,"And that's just the herbivores. I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores, their heads are already too big. Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development.",val
Chandler Bing,Really?,val
Ross Geller,"But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...",val
Joey Tribbiani,"He said ""erectus""!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, he really said it.",val
Ross Geller,... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...,val
Joey Tribbiani,Erectus?,val
Rachel Green,Homo.,val
Ross Geller,... in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century. Thank you!,val

Ross Geller,Ok!... Uh... excuse me? Yeah?,val
Ross Geller,Hey! Well...?,val
Ross Geller,Yeah?,val
Ross Geller,"Oh, I can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face! I mean... uh, did you know you were mouthing the words along with me?",val
Ross Geller,"No, it's ok! Made me feel like a rock star!",val
Ross Geller,I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room!,val
Ross Geller,"Look, I took it too far!",val
Monica Geller,"I can't believe it's raining again! Oh, it's so unfair!!!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Well, on the bright side, now you won't have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off. Not you guys. You got it going on!",val
Monica Geller,"So, what are we gonna do today?",val
Monica Geller,"Ping pong? Honey, they have ping pong! Let's play!",val
Chandler Bing,I don't think so!,val
Monica Geller,Why not?,val
Chandler Bing,"Because you know how competitive you get and well, I say it's cute, others disagree, and I'm lying!",val
Monica Geller,I'm not always that bad!,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh, yeah? What happened when we played last time?",val
Monica Geller,I punched you...?,val
Chandler Bing,And...?,val
Monica Geller,... Phoebe...?,val
Phoebe Buffay,... and...?,val
Monica Geller,I clunked your heads together!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! As soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling! Some kid told me about the sea turtle and, if you blow bubbles in its face, it chases ya!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh... oh, but that's ok, I'll find someone else to do it... I'll do it alone, but... I don't know what happens if the sea turtle catches you...",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Hey! Don't worry about it! It was fine! I ended up having the best time with Rachel! I just felt bad for you, stuck in that room, working on Ross's speech...",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh! Oh, well! At least we're both having fun!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah! A little bit, yeah...",val
Joey Tribbiani,Yeah... I think we do... ... about what?,val
Monica Geller,"C'mon guys, it'll be fun!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"All right, all right... I'll play if we don't keep score!",val
Monica Geller,But then how do we know who wins?,val
Phoebe Buffay,Nobody wins!,val
Monica Geller,"So, we're just four losers... SUPER!",val
Chandler Bing,I'm not playing with you.,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Yeah, I'm out.",val
Monica Geller,OK!,val
Phoebe Buffay,"Mike, you don't know, you don't know what you're doing!",val
Chandler Bing,She gets crazy! This scar is from Pictionary!,val

Monica Geller,Aww!,val
Chandler Bing,"Oh dear God, there's two of them!",val
Monica Geller,"Hell, yeah!",val

Phoebe Buffay,No idea! I though he was soft like you!,val
Monica Geller,How much were you thinking?,val
Monica Geller,Make it fifty!,val
Monica Geller,One thousand...,val
Chandler Bing,OK!,val
Monica Geller,No... Either of you girls got a quarter?,val
Chandler Bing,"Honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!",val
Phoebe Buffay,"Monica, you call it.",val
Monica Geller,"Heads! No, Tails! He-he-heads!",val
Phoebe Buffay,Tails!,val
Monica Geller,"Ow, what are the chances!",val
Monica Geller,Ha! My point!,val
Phoebe Buffay,He was a lawyer!,val
Rachel Green,Oh! Weather bitch!,val
Rachel Green,"It's open! Hi, Joe!",val
Joey Tribbiani,Hey...,val
Rachel Green,"What, is everything ok?",val
Joey Tribbiani,Uh... Charlie and I broke up.,val
Rachel Green,"Nooooo, why?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh well, she said we have nothing in common.",val
Rachel Green,"Oh, that's crazy!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, it's not, we have nothing in common!",val
Rachel Green,"... yeah, it's true.",val
Joey Tribbiani,"I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!",val
Rachel Green,"What, hey!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok, Rach!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"I feel so stupid, you know? Why... why do I keep going after the wrong girls?",val
Rachel Green,"W-What are you, what are you talking about?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Oh, c'mon, I mean, there's you, then there's Charlie, and it's like... What the hell is my problem? OH!",val
Rachel Green,Ok... uh... maybe you're not always going after the wrong girl...,val
Joey Tribbiani,"I'm telling you, Rach, Charlie is not right for me!",val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, I'm not talking about her...",val
Joey Tribbiani,But then who? The waitress I went out with last month?,val
Rachel Green,You know? Forget it!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"No-no-no-no, no! Who, who were you talking about?",val
Rachel Green,"No, I-I-I-I don't, I actually don't know who I'm talking about! So!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Ok! All right, well... I'm gonna see if I can get a room for the night and I'll... I'll see you later!",val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, sure!",val
Joey Tribbiani,You like me?,val
Rachel Green,"Ok, let's not make a big thing about this!",val
Joey Tribbiani,That's a huge thing!,val
Rachel Green,"Not working with me, Joe! Here's the thing: lately I have been having thoughts musings, if you will!",val
Joey Tribbiani,What... for how long?,val
Rachel Green,Only like a month!,val
Joey Tribbiani,A MONTH??,val
Rachel Green,"What the... DIAL IT DOWN! Listen, ok, and maybe they're crazy thoughts, but sometimes I do, I have, I've been thinking about... you know, us! Ok, dial it up a little!",val
Joey Tribbiani,I just have one question!,val
Rachel Green,Shoot!,val
Joey Tribbiani,What the hell are you doin'???,val
Rachel Green,"I don't know, I'm not trying to do anything, it's just, we have such a good time when we're together, you know... I mean, aren't you just a... little curious... what that would be like?...",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Uh, am I curious? I mean, I am as curious as... as... George!!",val
Rachel Green,Who...?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"CURIOUS GEORGE ! You know, the monkey, and the guy with the yellow hat!",val
Rachel Green,"Oh yes, of course, I remember him!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Yeah, he had a paper route.",val
Rachel Green,"Yeah, he did! Oh, see, this is what I'm talking about!",val
Joey Tribbiani,"No, I know, yeah I know we're great but Rach no... this... this can't happen!",val
Rachel Green,But can it... just... happen a little bit?,val
Joey Tribbiani,"NO, NO! It can't happen at all!",val
Rachel Green,"But why, why not?",val
Joey Tribbiani,"Because... look, no one wants this to happen more than me, ok? I have gone over this moment in my head a hundred times and not once did I ever say no! I couldn't do it to Ross!",val
Rachel Green,But that wasn't gonna stop you before!,val
Joey Tribbiani,"I know, I know! But I've thought about it a lot since, and it just wouldn't be right... I'm sorry...!",val
Rachel Green,"I'm sorry, too! OH GOD! I shouldn't have said anything!",val

Phoebe Buffay,"C'mon Mike, you can beat her! Knock that dog off her head!",val
Monica Geller,"Oh, damn it!",val
Phoebe Buffay,I sleep with him!,val

Phoebe Buffay,"Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.",test
Phoebe Buffay,"Okay, not a fan of the tough love.",test
Phoebe Buffay,"But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...",test
Phoebe Buffay,"Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you...

Rachel Green,"Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.",test
Joey Tribbiani,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory.",test
Rachel Green,"Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.",test
Joey Tribbiani,"Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.",test
